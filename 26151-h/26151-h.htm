<h2>AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT</h2>


<p>Modesty so dominates the staff in art museums that I
am requested not to make mention of those officers who
have helped me with friendly courtesy and efficiency. To
the officers and assistants at the Metropolitan Museum
of Art in New York, the Art Institute of Chicago, the
Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, and the Print Department
in the Library of Congress in Washington, indebtedness
is here publicly acknowledged with the regret that
I may not speak of individuals. Photographs of tapestries
are credited to Messrs. A. Giraudon, Paris; J. Laurent,
Madrid; Alinari, Florence; Wm. Baumgarten, and Albert
Herter, New York, and to those private collectors whose
names are mentioned on the plates.</p>

<h3>A FOREWORD</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE commercial fact that tapestries have immeasurably
increased in value within the last five
years, would have little interest were it not that
this increase is the direct result of America&rsquo;s awakened
appreciation of this form of art. It has come about in
these latter days that tapestries are considered a necessity
in the luxurious and elegant homes which are multiplying
all over our land. And the enormous demand thus
made on the supply, has sent the prices for rare bits into
a dizzy altitude, and has made even the less perfect pieces
seem scarce and desirable.</p>

<p>The opinion of two shrewd men of different types is
interesting as bearing on the subject of tapestries. One
with tastes fully cultivated says impressively, &ldquo;Buy good
old tapestries whenever you see them, for there are no
more.&rdquo; The other says bluffly, &ldquo;Tapestries? You can&rsquo;t
touch &rsquo;em. The prices have gone way out of sight, and
are going higher every day.&rdquo; The latter knows but one
view, the commercial, yet both are right, and these two
views are at the bottom of the present keen interest in
tapestries in our country. Outside of this, Europe has
collections which we never can equal, and that thought
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg&nbsp;2]</a></span>
alone is enough to make us snatch eagerly at any opportunity
to secure a piece. We may begin with our ambition
set on museum treasures, but we can come happily
down to the friendly fragments that fit our private purses
and the wall-space by the inglenook.</p>

<p>Tapestries are not to be bought lightly, as one buys a
summer coat, to throw aside at the change of taste or
circumstance. They demand more of the buyer than
mere money; they demand that loving understanding and
intimate appreciation that exists between human friends.
A profound knowledge of tapestries benefits in two ways,
by giving the keenest pleasure, and by providing the collector&mdash;or
the purchaser of a single piece&mdash;with a self-protection
that is proof against fraud, unconscious or deliberate.</p>

<p>The first step toward buying must be a bit of pleasant
study which shall serve in the nature of self-defence.
Not by books alone, however, shall this subject be approached,
but by happy jaunts to sympathetic museums,
both at home and abroad, by moments snatched from the
touch-and-go talk of afternoon tea in some friend&rsquo;s salon
or library, or by strolling visits to dealers. These object
lessons supplement the book, as a study of entomology is
enlivened by a chase for butterflies in the flowery meads
of June, or as botany is made endurable by lying on a
bank of violets. All work and no play not only makes
Jack a dull boy, but makes dull reading the book he has
in hand.</p>

<p>The tale of tapestry itself carries us back to the unfathomable
East which has a trick at dates, making the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg&nbsp;3]</a></span>
Christian Era a modern epoch, and making of us but a
newly-sprung civilisation in the history of the old grey
world. After showing us that the East pre-empted originality
for all time, the history of tapestry lightly lifts us
over a few centuries and throws us into the romance of
Gothic days, then trails us along through increasing
European civilisation up to the great awakening, the
Renaissance. Then it loiters in the pleasant ways of the
kings of France during the Seventeenth and Eighteenth
Centuries, and finally falls upon modern effort, not limited
to Europe now, but nesting also in the New World
which is especially our own.</p>

<p>Tapestry, according to the interpretation of the word
used in this book, is a pictured cloth, woven by an artist
or a talented craftsman, in which the design is an integral
part of the fabric, and not an embroidery stitched on a
basic tissue. With this flat statement the review of tapestries
from antiquity until our time may be read without
fear of mistaking the term.</p>


<h4>THE LOOM</h4>

<p>The looms on which tapestries are made are such as
have been known as long as the history of man is known,
but we have come to call them high-warp and low-warp,
or as the French have it, <i>haute lisse</i> and <i>basse lisse</i>. In
the celebrated periods of weaving the high loom has been
the one in use, and to it is accredited a power almost
mysterious; yet the work of the two styles of loom are not
distinguishable by the weave alone, and it is true that the
low-warp looms were used in France when the manufacture
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg&nbsp;4]</a></span>
of tapestries was permanently established by the
Crown about 1600. So difficult is it to determine the
work of the two looms that weavers themselves could not
distinguish without the aid of a red thread which they
at one time wove in the border. Yet because the years
of the highest perfection in tapestries have been when the
high loom was in vogue, some peculiar power is supposed
to reside within it. That the high movements of the fine
arts have been contemporary with perfection in tapestries,
seems not to be taken into consideration.</p>


<h4>NECESSARY FRENCH TERMS</h4>

<p>French terms belong so much to the art of tapestry
weaving that it is hard to find their English equivalent.
Tapestries of <i>verdure</i> and of <i>personnages</i> describe the
two general classes, the former being any charming mass
of greenery, from the Gothic <i>millefleurs</i>, and curling
leaves with animals beneath, to the lovely landscapes of
sophisticated park and garden which made Beauvais
famous in the Eighteenth Century. <i>Tapisseries des personnages</i>
have, as the name implies, the human figure as
the prominent part of the design. The shuttle or bobbin
of the high loom is called a <i>broche</i>, and that of the low
loom a <i>flute</i>. Weavers throughout Europe, whether in
the Low Countries or in France, were called <i>tapissiers</i>,
and this term was so liberal as to need explaining.</p>


<h4>WORKERS&rsquo; FUNCTIONS</h4>

<p>The tapestry factory was under the guidance of a
director; under him were the various persons required for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg&nbsp;5]</a></span>
the work. Each tapestry woven had a directing artist, as
the design was of primary importance. This man had
the power to select the silks and wools for the work, that
they might suit his eye as to colour. But there was also
a <i>chef d&rsquo;atelier</i> who was an artist weaver, and he directed
this matter and all others when the artist of the cartoons
was not present. Under him were the tapissiers who
did the actual weaving, and under these, again, were the
apprentices, who began as boys and served three years
before being allowed to try their hands at a &ldquo;&rsquo;prentice
job&rdquo; or essay at finished work.</p>


<h4>WEAVERS</h4>

<p>The word weaver means so little in these days that it
is necessary to consider what were the conditions exacted
of the weavers of tapestries in the time of tapestry&rsquo;s highest
perfection. A tapissier was an artist with whom a
loom took place of an easel, and whose brush was a
shuttle, and whose colour-medium was thread instead of
paints. This places him on a higher plane than that of
mere weaver, and makes the term tapissier seem fitter.
Much liberty was given him in copying designs and
choosing colours. In the Middle Ages, when the Gothic
style prevailed, the master-weaver needed often no other
cartoon for his work than his own sketches enlarged from
the miniatures found in the luxurious missals of the day.
These historic books were the luxuries of kings, were
kept with the plate and jewels, so precious were considered
their exquisitely painted scenes in miniature. From
them the master-weaver drew largely for such designs
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg&nbsp;6]</a></span>
as <i>The Seven Deadly Sins</i> and other &ldquo;morality&rdquo; subjects.</p>

<p>Master-weavers were many in the best years of tapestry
weaving; indeed, a man must have attained the dignity
and ability of that position before being able to produce
those marvels of skill which were woven between 1475
and 1575 in Flanders, France and Italy. Their aids, the
apprentices, pique the fancy, as Puck harnessed to labour
might do. They were probably as mischievous, as shirking,
as exasperating as boys have ever known how to be,
but those little unwilling slaves of art in the Middle Ages
make an appeal to the imagination more vivid than that
of the shabby lunch-box boy of to-day.</p>


<h4>DYERS</h4>

<p>Accessory to the weavers, and almost as important,
were the dyers who prepared the thread for use. The
conscientiousness of their work cries out for recognition
when the threads they dyed are almost unaltered in colour
after five hundred years of exposure to their enemies,
light and air. Dye stuffs were precious in those days,
and so costly that even threads of gold and silver (which
in general were supplied by the client ordering the tapestry)
hardly exceeded in value certain dyed wools and
silk. All of these workers, from director down to apprenticed
lad, were bound by the guild to do or not do,
according to its infinite code, to the end that the art of
tapestry-making be held to the highest standards. The
laws of the guilds make interesting reading. The guild
prevailed all over Europe and regulated all crafts. In
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg&nbsp;7]</a></span>
Florence even to-day evidences of its power are on every
side, and the Guildhall in London attests its existence
there. Moreover, the greatest artists belonged to the
guilds, uniting themselves usually by work of the goldsmith,
as Benvenuto Cellini so quaintly describes in his
na&iuml;ve autobiography.</p>


<h4>GUILDS</h4>

<p>It was these same protective laws of the guilds that
in the end crippled the hand of the weaver. The laws
grew too many to comply with, in justice to talent, and
talent with clipped wings could no longer soar. At the
most brilliant period of tapestry production Flanders was
to the fore. All Europe was appreciating and demanding
the unequalled products of her ateliers. It was but
human to want to keep the excellence, to build a wall of
restrictions around her especial craft that would prevent
rivals, and at the same time to press the ateliers to execute
all the orders that piled in toward the middle of the
Sixteenth Century.</p>

<p>But although the guilds could make wise laws and enforce
them, it could not execute in haste and retain the
standard of excellence. And thus came the gradual decay
of the art in Brussels, a decay which guild-laws had
no power to arrest.</p>


<h4>GOTHIC PERIOD</h4>

<p>The first period in tapestries which interests&mdash;except
the remnants of Egyptian and aboriginal work&mdash;is that
of the Middle Ages, the early Gothic, because that is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg&nbsp;8]</a></span>
when the art became a considerable one in Europe. It
is a time of romance, of chivalry, of deep religious feeling,
and yet seems like the childhood of modernity. Is
it the fault of crudity in pictorial art, or the fault of
romances that we look upon those distant people as more
elemental than we, and thus feel for them the indulgent
compassion that a child excites? However it is, theirs
is to us a simple time of primitive emotion and romance,
and the tapestries they have left us encourage the whim.</p>

<p>The time of Gothic perfection in tapestry-making is
included in the few years lying between 1475 and 1520.
Life was at that time getting less difficult, and art had
time to develop. It was no longer left to monks and
lonely ladies, in convent and castle, but was the serious
consideration of royalty and nobility. No need to dwell
on the story of modern art, except as it affects the art of
tapestry weaving. With the improvement of drawing
that came in these years, a greater excellence of weave
was required to translate properly the meaning of the
artist. The human face which had hitherto been either
blank or distorted in expression, now required a treatment
that should convey its subtlest shades of expression.
Gifted weavers rose to the task, became almost inspired
in the use of their medium, and produced such works of
their art as have never been equalled in any age. These
are the tapestries that grip the heart, that cause a <i>frisson</i>
of joy to the beholder. And these are the tapestries we
buy, if kind chance allows. If they cannot be ours to
live with, then away to the museum in all haste and often,
to feast upon their beauties.</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg&nbsp;9]</a></span></p>

<h4>RENAISSANCE</h4>

<p>That great usurper, the Renaissance, came creeping up
to the North where the tapestry looms were weaving
fairy webs. Pope Pius X wanted tapestries, those of the
marvellous Flemish weave. But he wanted those of
the new style of drawing, not the sweet restraint and
finished refinement of the Gothic. Raphael&rsquo;s cartoons
were sent to Brussels&rsquo; workshops, and thus was the North
inoculated with the Renaissance, and thus began the
second phase of the supreme excellency of Flemish tapestries.
It was the Renaissance expressing itself in the
wondrous textile art. The weavers were already perfect
in their work, no change of drawing could perplex them.
But to their deftness with their medium was now added
the rich invention of the Italian artists of the Renaissance,
at the period of perfection when restraint and delicacy
were still dominant notes.</p>

<p>It was the overworking of the craft that led to its
decadence. Toward the end of the Sixteenth Century
the extraordinary period of Brussels perfection had
passed.</p>

<p>But tapestry played too important a part in the life
and luxury of those far-away centuries for its production
to be allowed to languish. The magnificence of every
great man, whether pope, king or dilettante, was ill-expressed
before his fellows if he were not constantly
surrounded by the storied cloths that were the indispensable
accessories of wealth and glory. Palaces and
castles were hung with them, the tents of military
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg&nbsp;10]</a></span>
encampments were made gorgeous with their richness, and
no joust nor city procession was conceivable without their
colours flaunting in the sun as background to plumed
knights and fair ladies. Venice looked to them to
brighten her historic stones on days of carnival, and Paris
spread them to welcome kings.</p>


<h4>FRANCE</h4>

<p>When, therefore, Brussels no longer supplied the tissues
of her former excellence, opportunity came for some
other centre to rise. The next important producer was
Paris, and in Paris the art has consistently stayed. Other
brief periods of perfection have been attained elsewhere,
but Paris once establishing the art, has never let it drop,
not even in our own day&mdash;but that is not to be considered
at this moment.</p>

<p>Divers reigns of divers kings, notably that of Henri
IV, fostered the weaving of tapestry and brought it to
an interesting stage of development, after which Louis
XIV established the Gobelins. From that time on for a
hundred years France was without a rival, for the decadent
work of Brussels could not be counted as such.
Although the work of Italy in the Seventeenth Century
has its admirers, it is guilty of the faults of all of Italy&rsquo;s
art during the dominance of Bernini&rsquo;s ideals.</p>


<h4>AMERICAN INTEREST</h4>

<p>America is too late on the field to enter the game of
antiquity. We have no history of this wonderful textile
art to tell. But ours is the power to acquire the lovely
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg&nbsp;11]</a></span>
examples of the marvellous historied hangings of other
times and of those nations which were our forebears before
the New World was discovered. And we are
acquiring them from every corner of Europe where they
may have been hiding in old ch&acirc;teau or forgotten chest.
To the museums go the most marvellous examples given
or lent by those altruistic collectors who wish to share
their treasures with a hungry public. But to the mellow
atmosphere of private homes come the greater part of
the tapestries. To buy them wisely, a smattering of their
history is a requisite. Within the brief compass of this
book is to be found the points important for the amateur,
but for a profounder study he must turn to those huge
volumes in French which omit no details.</p>

<p>Not entirely by books can he learn. Association with
the objects loved, counts infinitely more in coming to an
understanding. Happy he who can make of tapestries
the <i>raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</i> for a few months&rsquo; loitering in Europe,
and can ravish the eye and intoxicate the imagination
with the storied cloths found hanging in England, in
France, in Spain, in Italy, in Sweden, and learn from
them the fascinating tales of other men&rsquo;s lives in other
men&rsquo;s times.</p>

<p>Then, when the tour is finished and a modest tapestry
is hung at home, it represents to its instructed owner the
concentrated tale of all he has seen and learned. In
the weave he sees the ancient craftsman sitting at his
loom. In the pattern is the drawing of the artist of
the day, in the colours, the dyes most rare and costly;
in the metal, the gold and silver of a duke or prince; and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg&nbsp;12]</a></span>
in the tale told by the figures he reads a romance of chivalry
or history, which has the glamour given by the haze
of distant time to human action.</p>

<p>To enter a house where tapestries abound, is to feel
oneself welcomed even before the host appears. The
bending verdure invites, the animated figures welcome,
and at once the atmosphere of elegance and cordiality
envelopes the happy visitor.</p>

<p>To live in a house abundantly hung with old tapestries,
to live there day by day, makes of labour a pleasure
and of leisure a delight. It is no small satisfaction in
our work-a-day life to live amidst beauty, to be sure that
every time the eyes are raised from the labour of writing
or sewing&mdash;or of bridge whist, if you like&mdash;they encounter
something worthy and lovely. In the big living-room
of the home, when the hours come in which the
family gathers, on a rainy morning, or on any afternoon
when the shadows grow grim outside and the afternoon
tea-tray is brought in whispering its discreet tune
of friendly communion, the tapestries on the walls seem
to gather closer, to enfold in loving embrace the sheltered
group, to promise protection and to augment brotherly
love.</p>

<p>In the dining-room the glorious company assembles, so
that he who eats therein, attends a feast on Olympus, even
though the dyspeptic&rsquo;s fast be his lot. If the eyes gaze
on Coypel&rsquo;s gracious ladies, under fruit and roses, with
adolescent gods adoring, what matters if the palate is
chastised? In a dining-room soft-hung with piquant
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg&nbsp;13]</a></span>
scenes, even buttermilk and dog-biscuit, burnt canvasback
and cold Burgundy lose half their bitterness.</p>

<p>When night is well started in its flight, perhaps one
only, one lover of the silence and the solitude, loath to
give away to soft sleep the quiet hours, this one remains
behind when all the others have flown bedward, and to
him the neighbouring tapestries speak a various language.
From the easy chair he sees the firelight play on the
verdure with the effect of a summer breeze, the gracious
foliage all astir. The figures in this enchanted wood are
set in motion and imagination brings them into the life
of the moment, makes of them sympathetic playmates
coaxing one to love, as they do, the land of romance.
Before their imperturbable jocundity what bad humour
can exist? All the old songs of mock pastoral times come
singing in the ears, &ldquo;It happened on a day, in the merry
month of May,&rdquo; &ldquo;Shepherds all and maidens fair,&rdquo; &ldquo;It
was a lover and his lass,&rdquo; &ldquo;Ph&oelig;bus arise, and paint the
skies,&rdquo; <i>et cetera</i>. Animated by the fire, in the silence of
the winter night the loving horde gathers and ministers to
the mind afflicted with much hard practicality and the
strain of keeping up with modern inexorable times.
This sweet procession on the walls, thanks be to lovely
art, needs no keeping up with, merely asks to scatter joy
and to soften the asperities of a too arduous day.</p>

<p>All the way up the staircase in the house of tapestries
are dainty bits of <i>millefleurs</i>, that Gothic invention for
transferring a block of the spring woods from under the
trees into a man-made edifice. It may have a deep indigo
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg&nbsp;14]</a></span>
background or a dull red&mdash;like the shades of moss or like
last year&rsquo;s fallen leaves&mdash;but over it all is abundantly
sprinkled dainty bluebells, anemones, daisies, all the
spring beauties in joyous self-assertion and happy mingling.
With such flowery guides to mark the way the
path to slumberland is followed. Once within the bedroom,
the poppies of the hangings spread drowsy influence,
and the happy sleeper passes into unconsciousness,
passes through the flowered border of the ancient square,
into the scene beyond, becomes one of those storied persons
in the enchanted land and lives with them in jousts
and tourneys or in <i>f&ecirc;tes champ&ecirc;tres</i> at lovely ch&acirc;teaux.
The magic spell of the house of tapestries has fallen like
the dew from heaven to bless the striver in our modern
life of exigency and fatigue.</p>

<h2 class="padtop">CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>ANTIQUITY</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">E</span>GYPT and China, India and Persia, seem made to
take the conceit from upstart nations like those of
Europe and our own toddling America. Directly
we scratch the surface and look for the beginning
of applied arts, the lead takes us inevitably to the oldest
civilisation. It would seem that in a study of fabrics
which are made in modern Europe, it were enough to
find their roots in the medi&aelig;val shades of the dark ages;
but no, back we must go to the beginning of history
where man leaped from the ambling dinosaur, which
then modestly became extinct, and looking upon the lands
of the Nile and the Yangtsi-kiang found them good, and
proceeded to pre-empt all the ground of applied arts, so
that from that time forward all the nations of the earth
were and are obliged to acknowledge that there is nothing
new under the sun.</p>

<p>In the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York is a
bit of tapestry, Coptic, that period where Greek and
Egyptian drawing were intermixed, a woman&rsquo;s head
adorned with much vanity of head-dress, woven two or
three centuries after Christ. (Plate facing page <a href="#COPTIC_TAPESTRY01"><b>15</b></a>.)
In the Boston Museum of Fine Arts are other rare specimens
of this same time. (Plates facing pages <a href="#COPTIC_TAPESTRY02"><b>16</b></a>
and <a href="#COPTIC_TAPESTRY03"><b>17</b></a>.)
Looking further back, an ancient decoration shows Penelope
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg&nbsp;16]</a></span>
at her high loom, four hundred years before the
Christian era; and one, still older, shows the Egyptians
weaving similarly three thousand years before that epoch.</p>

<p>It is not altogether thrilling to read that civilised people
of ancient times wove fabrics for dress and decoration,
but it certainly is interesting to learn that they were
masters of an art which we carelessly attribute to Europe
of six centuries back, and to find that the weaving apparatus
and the mode of work were almost identical. The
Coptic tapestry of the Third Century is woven in the
same manner as the tapestries that come to us from Europe
as the flower of comparatively recent times, and its
dyes and treatment of shading are identical with the
Gothic times. Penelope&rsquo;s loom as pictured on an ancient
vase, is the same in principle as the modern high-warp
loom, although lacking a bit in convenience to the
weaver; and so we can easily imagine the lovely lady at
work on her famous web, &ldquo;playing for time,&rdquo; during
Ulysses&rsquo; absence, when she sat up o&rsquo; nights undoing her
lovely stint of the day.</p>

<p>And the Egyptian loom shown in ancient pictures&mdash;that
is even more modern than Penelope&rsquo;s, although it
was set up three thousand years before, a last guide-post
on the backward way to the misty land called prehistoric.</p>

<p>But as there is really little interest except for the
archeologist in digging so far into the past for an art
that has left us but traditions and museum fragments, let
us skim but lightly the surface of this time, only picking
up the glistening facts that attract the mind&rsquo;s eye, so that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg&nbsp;17]</a></span>
we may quickly reach the enchanted land of more recent
times which yet appear antique to the modern.</p>

<p>There are those to whom reading the Bible was a
forced task during childhood, a class which slipped the
labour as soon as years gave liberty of choice. There
are others who have always turned as naturally to its
accounts of grand ceremony and terrible battles as to the
accounts of C&aelig;sar, C&oelig;ur de Lion, Charlemagne. But
in either case, whatever the reason for the eye to absorb
these pages of ancient Hebrew history, the impression is
gained of superb pomp. And always concerned with
it are descriptions of details, lovingly impressed, as
though the chronicler was sure of the interest of his audience.
In this enumeration, decorative textiles always
played a part. Such textiles as they were exceed in extravagance
of material any that we know of European
production, for in many cases they were woven entirely of
gold and silver, and even set with jewels. These gorgeous
fabrics shone like suns on the magnificent pomp of
priest and ruler, and declared the wealth and power of
the nation. They departed from the original intention
of protecting shivering humanity from chill draughts or
from close and cold association with the stones of architectural
construction, and became a luxury of the eye, a
source of bewilderment to the fancy and a lively intoxication
to those who&mdash;irrespective of class, or of century&mdash;love
to compute display in coin.</p>

<p>But, dipping into the history of one ancient country
after another, it is easy to see that the usual fabric for
hanging was woven of wool, of cotton and of silk, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg&nbsp;18]</a></span>
carried the design in the weaving. Babylon the great,
Egypt under the Pharaohs, Greece in its heroic times,
Rome under the Emperors&mdash;not omitting China and
India of the Far East&mdash;these countries of ancient peoples
all knew the arts of dyeing and weaving, of using the
materials that we employ, and of introducing figures
symbolic, geometric, or realistic into the weaving. Beyond
a doubt the high loom has been known to man since
prehistoric times. It may be discouraging to those who
like to feel that tapestry properly belongs to Europe only,&mdash;Europe
of the last six centuries&mdash;to find that the art
has been sifted down through the ages; but in reality it is
but one more link between us and the centuries past, the
human touch that revivifies history, that unites humanity.
People of the past wear a haze about them, are immovable
and rigid as their pictured representations. The Assyrian
is to us a huge man of impossible beard, the
Egyptian is a lean angle fixed in posture, the Greek is
eternally posed for the sculptor.</p>

<p>But once we can find that these people were not forever
transfixed to frieze, but were as simple, as industrious,
as human as we, the kinship is established, and
through their veins begins to flow the stream that is common
to all humanity. These people felt the same need
for elegantly covering the walls of their homes that we
in this country of new homes feel, and the craftsmen led
much the same lives as do craftsmen of to-day. Even in
the matter of expense, of money which purchasers were
willing to spend for woven decorative fabrics, we see no
novelty in the high prices of to-day, the Twentieth

Century. <i>The Mantle of Alcisthenes</i> is celebrated for having
been bought by the Carthaginians for the equal of a
hundred thousand dollars.</p>

<p>Thus we connect ourselves with the remote past in
making a continuous history. But as the purpose of this
book is to assist the owner of tapestries to understand the
story of his hangings and to enable the purchaser or collector
to identify tapestries on his own knowledge instead
of through the prejudiced statements of the salesman, it
is useless to dwell long upon the fabrics that we can only
see through exercise of the imagination or in disintegrated
fragments in museums.</p>

<p>Then away with Circe and her leisure hours of weaving,
with Helen and her heroic canvas, and the army of
grandiose Biblical folk, and let us come westward into
Europe in short review of the textiles called tapestry
which were produced from the early Christian centuries
to the time of the Crusades, and thus will we approach
more modern times.</p>

<p>So far as known, high-warp weaving was not universally
used in Europe in the first part of the Middle Ages.
Whether plain or figured, most of the fabrics of that
time that have come down to us for hangings or for clothing,
are woven, with the decorative pattern executed by
the needle on woven cloth. In Persia and neighbouring
states, however, the high-warp loom was used.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Europe in the Middle Ages was a place so savage, so
devastated by war and by neighbouring malice, that to
consider it is to hear the clash of steel, to feel the pangs
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg&nbsp;20]</a></span>
of hunger, to experience the fearsome chill of dungeons
or moated castles. It was a time when those who could
huddle in fortresses mayhap died natural deaths, but
those who lived in the world were killed as a matter of
course. Man was man&rsquo;s enemy and to be killed on sight.</p>

<p>In such gay times of carnage, art is dead. Men there
were who drew designs and executed them, for the <i>luxe</i>
of the eye is ever demanding, but the designs were timid
and stunted and came far from the field of art. Fabrics
were made and worn, no doubt, but when looms were
like to be destroyed and the weavers with them, scant attention
was given to refinements.</p>

<p>By the time the Tenth Century was reached matters
had improved. We come into the light of records. It
is positively known that the town of Saumur, down in
the lovely country below Tours, became the destination
of a quantity of wall-hangings, carpets, curtains, and seat
covers woven of wool. This was by order of the third
Abbot Robert of the Monastery of St. Florent, one of
those vigorous, progressive men whose initiative inspires
a host. It is recorded that he also ordered two pieces of
tapestry executed, not of wool exclusively, but with silk
introduced, and in these the figures of the designs were
the beasts that were then favourites in decoration and that
still showed the influence of Oriental drawing.</p>

<p>Before enumerating other authentic examples of early
tapestries it is well to speak of the reason for their being
invariably associated with the church. The impression
left by history is that folk of those days must have been
universally religious when not cutting each other in bits
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg&nbsp;21]</a></span>
with bloody cutlass. The reason is, of course, that when
poor crushed humanity began to revive from the devastating
onslaughts of fierce Northern barbarians, it was
with a timid huddling in monasteries, for there was
found immunity from attack. The lord of the castle was
forced to go to war or to resist attack in his castle, but
the monastery was exempt from whatever conscription
the times imposed, and frocked friars were always on
hand were defence needed. Thus it came about that
monasteries became treasure-houses, the only safe ones,
were built strong, were sufficiently manned, and therefore
were the safe-deposit of whatever articles of concentrated
value the great lord of the Middle Ages might
accumulate. Many tapestries thus deposited became
gifts to the institution which gave them asylum.</p>

<p>The arts and crafts of the Middle Ages were in the
hands of the monasteries, monks and friars being the
only persons with safety and leisure. Weaving fell naturally
to them to execute as an art. In the castles, necessary
weaving for the family was done by the women, as
on every great lord&rsquo;s domains were artisans for all crafts;
and great ladies emulated Penelope and Helen of old in
passing their hours of patience and anxiety with fabricating
gorgeous cloths. But these are exceptional, and
deal with such grand ladies as Queen Matilda, who with
her maidens embroidered (not wove) the Bayeux Tapestry,
and with the Duchess Gonnor, wife of Richard First,
who embroidered for the church of Notre Dame at
Rouen a history of the Virgin and Saints.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg&nbsp;22]</a></span>
To the monasteries must be given the honour of preserving
this as many other arts, and of stimulating the
laity which had wealth and power to present to religious
institutions the best products of the day. The subjects
executed inside the monastery were perforce religious,
many revelling in the horrors of martyrology, and those
intended as gifts or those ordered by the clergy were
religious in subject for the sake of appropriateness. It
is interesting to note the sweet childlike attitude of all
lower Europe toward the church in these years, a sort of
infantile way of leaving everything in its hands, all
knowledge, all wisdom, all power. It was not even
necessary to read or write, as the clergy conveniently concerned
themselves with literacy. As late as the beginning
of the Fifteenth Century Philip the Hardy, the
great Duke of Burgundy, in ordering a tapestry, signed
the order, not with his autograph, for he could not, but
with his mark, for he, too, left pen-work to the clerks of
the church.</p>

<p>That pile of concentrated royal history, the old abbey
of St. Denis, received, late in the Tenth Century, one of
the evidences of royal patronage that every abbey must
have envied. It was a woven representation of the
world, as scientists of that day imagined our half-discovered
planet, and was presented by Queen Adelaide,
the wife of Hugh Capet, whose descendants reigned for
three hundred years.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>While dealing with records rather than with objects
on which the eye can gaze and the hand can rest, note
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg&nbsp;23]</a></span>
must be made of an order of a Count of Poitou, William
V, to a factory for tapestries then existing in Poitiers,
showing that the art of weaving had in that spot jumped
the monastery walls in 1025.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> The order was for a large
hanging with subjects taken from the Scriptures, but
given the then modern touch by introducing portraits of
kings and emperors and their favourite animals transfixed
in ways peculiar to the nature of the day.</p>

<p>A century later, another Abbot of St. Florent in
Saumur had hangings made important enough to be recorded.
One of these represented the four and twenty
elders of the Apocalypse with musical instruments, and
other subjects taken from the Revelation of John. This
subject was one of unending interest to the artists of that
time who seemed to find in its depicting a serving of both
God and imagination.</p>

<p>Among the few tapestries of this period, those of the
Cathedral at Halberstadt must be mentioned, partly by
way of conscientious chronicling, partly that the interested
traveller may, as he travels, know where to find the
rare specimens of the hobby he is pursuing. This is a
high-warp tapestry which authorities variously place as
the product of the Eleventh or the Twelfth Centuries.
Entirely regardless of its age, it has for us the charm of the
craft of hands long vanished, and of primitive art in all
its simplicity of artifice. The subject is religious&mdash;could
hardly have been otherwise in those monastic days&mdash;and
for church decoration, and to fit the space they were
woven to occupy, each of the two parts was but three
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg&nbsp;24]</a></span>
and a half feet high although more than fourteen yards
long.</p>

<p>Each important event recorded in history has its expression
in the material product of its time, and this is one
of the charms of studying the liberal arts. Tapestry more
than almost any other handicraft has left us a pictured
history of events in a time when records were scarce.
The effect of the Crusades was noticeable in the impetus
it gave to tapestry, not only by bringing Europe into fresh
contact with Oriental design but by increasing the desire
for luxurious stuffs. The returning crusaders&mdash;what
traveller&rsquo;s tales did they not tell of the fabrics of the
great Oriental sovereigns and their subjects, the soft rugs,
the tent coverings, the gorgeous raiment; and these tales
they illustrated with what fragments they could port in
their travellers&rsquo; packs. Here lay inspiration for a continent.</p>

<h2 class="padtop">CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>MODERN AWAKENING</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>N the Fourteenth Century, tapestry, the high-warp
product, began to play an important part in the refinements
of the day. We have seen the tendency of the
past time to embellish and soften churches and monastic
institutions with hangings. Records mostly in clerical
Latin, speak of these as curtains for doorways, dossers
for covering seats, and the backs of benches, and baldachins,
as well as carpets for use on the floor. Subjects
were ecclesiastic, as the favourite Apocalypse; or classic,
like that of the Quedlimburg hanging which fantastically
represents the marriage of Mercury and Philology.</p>

<p>But in the Thirteenth Century the political situation
had improved and men no longer slept in armour and
women no longer were prepared to thrust all household
valuables into a coffer on notice that the enemy was
approaching over the plains or up the rocks. Therefore,
homes began to be a little less rude in their comforts.
Stone walls were very much the rule inside as well as
out, but it became convenient then to cover their grim
asperities with the woven draperies, the remains of which
so interest us to-day, and which we in our accession of
luxuriousness would add to the already gently finished
apartments. To put ourselves back into one of those
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg&nbsp;26]</a></span>
castle homes we are to imagine a room of stone walls,
fitted with big iron hooks, on which hung pictured
tapestry which reached all around, even covering the
doors in its completeness. To admit of passing in and
out the door a slit was made, or two tapestries joined at
this spot. Set Gothic furniture scantily about such a
room, a coffer or two, some high-backed chairs, a generous
table, and there is a room which the art of to-day
with its multiple ingenuity cannot surpass for beauty and
repose.</p>

<p>But such a room gave opportunity for other matters
in the Thirteenth Century. Customs were less polite and
morals more primitive. Important people desiring important
information were given to the spying and eavesdropping
which now has passed out of polite fashion.
And those ancient rooms favoured the intriguer, for the
hangings were suspended a foot or two away from the
wall, and a man or a woman, for that matter, might easily
slip behind and witness conversations to which the listener
had not been invited. So it was customary on occasions
of intimate and secret converse lightly to thrust a
sharpened blade behind the curtains. If, as in the case
in &ldquo;Hamlet,&rdquo; the sword pierced a human quarry, so much
the worse for the listener who thus gained death and lost
its dignity.</p>

<p>Before leaving this ancient chamber it is well to impress
ourselves with the interesting fact that tapestries
were originally meant to be suspended loosely, liberally,
from the upper edge only, and to fall in folds or gentle
undulations, thus gaining in decorative value and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg&nbsp;27]</a></span>
elegance. This practice had an important effect on the
design, and also gave an appearance of movement to
human figures and to foliage, as each swayed in light
folds.</p>

<p>When considering tapestries of the Thirteenth Century
we are only contemplating the stones of history, for the
actual products of the looms of that time are not for us;
they are all gathered into museums, public or ecclesiastic.
The same might be said of tapestries of the Fourteenth
Century, and almost of the Fifteenth. But those old times
are so full of romance, that their history is worth our
toying with. It adds infinite joy to the possessing of old
tapestries, and converts museum visits into a keen chase
for the elusive but fascinating figures of the past.</p>

<p>Let us then absorb willingly one or two dry facts.
High-warp tapestry we have traced lightly from Egypt
through Greece and Rome and, almost losing the thread
in the Middle Ages, have seen it rising a virile industry,
nursed in monasteries. It was when the stirrings of
artistic life were commencing under the Van Eycks in
the North and under Giotto and the Tuscans in the South
that the weaving of tapestries reached a high standard
of production and from that time until the Nineteenth
Century has been an important artistic craft. The Thirteenth
Century saw it started, the Fourteenth saw the
beginnings of important factories, and the Fifteenth
bloomed into full productions and beauty of the style we
call Gothic.</p>

<p>In these early times of the close of the Thirteenth Century
and the beginning of the Fourteenth, the best known
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg&nbsp;28]</a></span>
high-warp factories were centred in northern and midland
provinces of France and Flanders, Paris and Arras
being the towns most famed for their productions. As
these were able to supply the rest of Europe, the skilled
technique was lost otherwheres, so that later, when Italy,
Germany and England wished to catch up again their
ancient work, they were obliged to ask instruction of the
Franco-Flemish high-warp workers.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>It is not possible in the light of history for either Paris
or Arras to claim the invention of so nearly a prehistoric
art as that of high-warp tapestry, and there is much discussion
as to which of these cities should be given the
honour of superiority and priority in the work of the
Twelfth and Thirteenth Centuries.</p>

<p>Factories existed at both places and each had its rules
of manufacture which regulated the workman and stimulated
its excellence. The factories at Paris, however,
were more given to producing copies of carpets brought
from the East by returning crusaders, and these were
intended for floors. The craftsmen were sometimes
alluded to as <i>tapissiers Sarrazinois</i>, named, as is easily
seen, after the Saracens who played so large a part in
the adventurous voyages of the day. But in Paris in
1302, by instigation of the Provost Pierre le Jumeau,
there were associated with these tapissiers or workmen,
ten others, for the purpose of making high-warp tapestry,
and these were bound with all sorts of oaths not to depart
from the strict manner of proceeding in this valued handicraft.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg&nbsp;29]</a></span>
Indeed, the Articles of Faith, nor the Vows of the
Rosicrucians, could not be more inviolable than the
promises demanded of the early tapestry workers. In
some cases&mdash;notably a factory of Brussels, Brabant, in
the Sixteenth Century&mdash;there were frightful penalties
attendant upon the breaking of these vows, like the loss
of an ear or even of a hand.</p>

<p>The records of the undertaking of the Provost Pierre
le Jumeau in introducing the high-warp (<i>haute lisse</i>)
workers into the factory where Sarrazinois and other
fabrics were produced, means only that the improvement
had begun, but not that Paris had never before practised
an art so ancient.</p>

<p>The name of Nicolas Bataille is one of the earliest
which we can surround with those props of records that
please the searcher for exact detail.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> He was both manufacturer
and merchant and was a man of Paris in the
reign of Charles VI, a king who patronised him so well
that the workshops of Paris benefited largely. The
king&rsquo;s brother becoming envious, tried to equal him in
personal magnificence and gave orders almost as large
as those of the king. Philip the Hardy, uncle of the
king, also employed this designer whose importance has
not lessened in the descent of the centuries.</p>

<p>What makes Bataille of special interest to us is that
we cannot only read of him in fascinating chronicles as
well as dry histories, but we can ourselves see his wondrous
works. In the cathedral at Angers hangs a tapestry
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg&nbsp;30]</a></span>
executed by him; it is a part of the <i>Apocalypse</i> (favourite
subject) drawn by Dourdin, who was artist of the cartoons
as well as artist to Charles V.</p>

<p>In those days the weaver occupied much the same place
in relation to the cartoonist as the etcher does now to the
painter. That is to say, that because the drawing was
his inspiration, the weaver was none the less an artist
of originality and talent.</p>

<p>These celebrated hangings at Angers, although commenced
in 1376 for Louis of Anjou, were not completed
in all the series until 1490, therefore Bataille&rsquo;s work was
on the first ones, finished on Christmas, 1379. The design
includes imposing figures, each seated on a Gothic
throne reading and meditating. The larger scenes are
topped with charming figures of angels in primitive skies
of the &ldquo;twisted ribbon&rdquo; style of cloud, angels whose duty
and whose joy is to trump eternally and float in defiance
of natural laws of gravitation.</p>

<p>The museum at the Gobelins factory in Paris shows
to wondering eyes the other authentic example of late
Fourteenth Century high-warp tapestry, as woven in the
early Paris workshops. It portrays with a lovely na&iuml;ve
simplicity <i>The Presentation in the Temple</i>. This with
the pieces of the <i>Apocalypse</i> at Angers are all that are
positively known to have come from the Paris workshops
of the late Fourteenth Century.</p>

<p>History steps in with an event that crushed the industry
in Paris. Just when design and execution were at their
highest excellence, and production was prolific, political
events began to annihilate the trade. The English King,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg&nbsp;31]</a></span>
Henry V, crossed the Channel and occupied Paris in
1422. Thus, under the oppression of the invaders, the
art of tapestry was discouraged and fell by the way, not
to rise lustily again in Paris for two hundred years.</p>

<h2 class="padtop">CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>FIFTEENTH CENTURY IN FRANCE AND FLANDERS</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>HETHER Arras began as early as Paris is a
question better left unsettled if only for the
sake of furnishing a subject of happy controversy
between the champions of the two opinions. But
certain it is that with fewer distractions to disturb her
craftsmen, and under the stimulus of certain ducal and
royal patrons, Arras succeeded in advancing the art more
than did her celebrated neighbour. It was Arras, too,
that gave the name to the fabric, a name which appears
in England as arras and in Italy as arazzo, as though there
was no other parent-region for the much-needed and
much-prized stuffs than the busy Flemish town.</p>

<p>Among the early records is found proof that in 1311,
a countess of the province of Artois, of which Arras was
the capital, bought a figured cloth in that city, and two
years later ordered various works in high warp.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> It is
she who became ruler of the province. To patronise the
busy town of her own domains, Arras, she ordered from
there the hangings that were its specialty. Paris also
shared her patronage. She took as husband Otho, Count
of Burgundy, and set his great family the fashion in the
way of patronising the tapestry looms.</p>

<p>It was in the time of Charles V of France, that the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg&nbsp;33]</a></span>
Burgundian duke Philip, called the Hardy, began to
patronise conspicuously the Arras factories. In 1393,
as de Barante delightfully chronicles, the gorgeous equipments
of this duke were more than amazing when he
went to arrange peace with the English at Lelingien.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>The town chosen for the pourparlers, wherein assembled
the English dukes, Lancaster and Gloucester and
their attendants, as well as the cort&eacute;ge attending the Duke
of Burgundy, was a poor little village ruined by wars.
The conferences were held by these superb old fighters
and statesmen in an ancient thatched chapel. To make
it presentable and worthy of the nobles, it was covered
with tapestries which entirely hid the ruined walls. The
subject of the superb pieces was a series of battles, which
made the Duke of Lancaster whimsically critical of a subject
ill-chosen for a peace conference, he suggesting that
it were better to have represented &ldquo;<i>la Passion de notre
Seigneur</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not satisfied with having the meeting place a gorgeous
and luxurious temple, this Philip, Duke of Burgundy,
demonstrated his magnificence in his own tent, which
was made of wooden planks entirely covered with &ldquo;toiles
peintes&rdquo; (authorities state that tapestries with personages
were thus described), and was in form of a ch&acirc;teau
flanked with towers. As a means of pleasing the English
dukes and the principal envoys, Philip gave to them
superb gifts of tapestries, the beautiful tapestries of
Flanders such as were made only in the territory of the
duke. It is interesting to note this authentic account
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg&nbsp;34]</a></span>
of the importation of certain Arras tapestries into England.</p>

<p>Subjects at this time introduced, besides Bible people,
figures of Clovis and of Charlemagne. Two hangings
represented, the one <i>The Seven Cardinal Vices</i>, with their
conspicuous royal exponents in the shape of seven vicious
kings and emperors; the other, <i>The Seven Cardinal Virtues</i>,
with the royalties who had been their notable exponents.
Here is a frank criticism on the lives of kings
which smacks of latter-day democracy. All these tapestries
were enriched with gold of Cyprus, as gold threads
were called.</p>

<p>This same magnificent Philip the Hardy, had other
treaties to make later on, and seeing how much his tapestries
were appreciated, continued to make presents of
them. One time it was the Duke of Brittany who had
to be propitiated, all in the interests of peace, peace being
a quality much sought and but little experienced at this
time in France. Perhaps this especial Burgundian duke
had a bit of self-interest in his desire for amity with the
English, for he was lord of the Comit&eacute; of Artois (including
Arras) and this was a district which, because of its
heavy commerce with England, might favour that country.
A large part of that commerce was wool for tapestry
weaving, wool which came from the <i>pr&eacute;s sal&eacute;s</i> of
Kent, where to-day are seen the same meadows, salt with
ocean spray and breezes, whereon flocks are grazing now
as of old&mdash;but this time more for mutton chops than for
tapestry wools.</p>

patronage was so stimulating to the factories of Flanders,
leads us to recall the horrors of the war with Bajazet, the
terrible Sultan of Turkey, and the way in which this cool
monster bartered human lives for human luxuries. It
was when the flower of France (1396) invaded his country
and was in the power of his hand, that he had the
brave company of nobles pass in review before his royal
couch that he might see them mutilated to the death.
Three or four only he retained alive, then sent one of
these, the Sire de Helly, back to his France with <i>parole
d&rsquo;honneur</i> to return&mdash;to amass, first, as big a ransom as
could be raised; this, if in the Turk&rsquo;s demanding eyes
it appeared sufficient, he would accept in exchange for
the remaining unhappy nobles.</p>

<p>Added to the money which de Helly was able to collect,
were superb tapestries of Arras contributed by the
Burgundian duke, Philip the Hardy. It was argued that
of these luxurious hangings, Bajazet had none, for the
looms of his country had not the craft to make tapestries
of personages. Cloth of gold and of silver, considered
an extreme elegance in France, they argued was no rarity
to the terrible Turk, for it was from Damascus in his
part of the world that this precious fabric came most
plentifully. So de Helly took Arras tapestries into
Turkey, a suite representing the history of Alexander the
Great, and the avaricious monarch was persuaded by reason
of this and other ransom to let his prisoners free.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>After the death of Philip the Hardy in 1404, his
accumulated luxuries had to be sold to help pay his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg&nbsp;36]</a></span>
fabulous debts. To this end his son sold, among other things,
his superb tapestries, and thus they became distributed in
Paris. And yet John without Fear, who succeeded
Philip, continued to stimulate the Arras weavers. In
1409 he ordered five big hangings representing his victories
of Li&eacute;ge, all battle subjects.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>Philip the Good was the next head of the Burgundian
house, and he it was who assisted in the sumptuous preparations
for the entry of the king, Louis XI, into Paris.
The king himself could scarcely equal in magnificence
this much-jewelled duke, whose splendour was a matter
of excitement to the populace. People ran to see him
in the streets or to the church, to feast their eyes on his
cort&eacute;ge, his mounted escort of a hundred knights who
were themselves dukes, princes and other nobles.</p>

<p>His house, in the old quarter of Paris, where we are
wont to wander with a Baedeker veiled, was the wonder
of all who were permitted to view its interior. Here he
had brought his magnificent Arras tapestries and among
them the set of the <i>History of Gideon</i>, which he had had
made in honour of the order of the Golden Fleece founded
by him at Bruges, in 1429, for, he said, the tale of Gideon
was more appropriate to the Fleece than the tale of Jason,
who had not kept his trust&mdash;a bit of unconventionalism
appreciable even at this distance of time.</p>

<p>Charles le T&eacute;m&eacute;raire&mdash;the Bold or rather the foolhardy&mdash;how
he used and lost his tapestries is of interest
to us, because his possessions fell into a place where we
can see them by taking a little trouble. Some of them
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg&nbsp;37]</a></span>
are among the treasures in the museum at Nancy and at
Berne in Switzerland. How they got there is in itself
a matter of history, the history of a war between Burgundy
and Switzerland.</p>

<p>Like all the line of these half-barbaric, picturesque
dukes, Charles could not disassociate himself from magnificence,
which in those days took the place of comfort.
When making war, he endeavoured to have his camp
lodgment as near as possible reproduce the elegance of
his home. In his campaign against Switzerland, his tent
was entirely hung with the most magnificent of tapestries.
After foolhardy onslaughts on a people whose strength
he miscalculated, he lost his battles, his life&mdash;and his
tapestries. And this is how certain Burgundian tapestries
hang in the cathedral at Berne, and in the museums
at Nancy.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>The simple Swiss mountaineers, accustomed more to
expediency than to luxury, are said to have been entirely
ignorant of the value of their spoils of war. Tapestries
they had never seen, nor had they the experienced eye
to discern their beauties; but cloth, thick woollen cloth,
that would protect shivering man from the cold, was a
commodity most useful; so, many of the fine products of
the high-warp looms that had augmented the pride of
their noble possessor, found their way into shops and were
sold to the Swiss populace in any desired length, according
to bourgeois household needs, a length for a warm
bed-cover, or a square for a table; and thus disappeared
so many that we are thankful for the few whole hangings
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg&nbsp;38]</a></span>
of that time which are ours to inspect, and which represent
the best work of the day both from Arras and from
Brussels, which was then (about 1476) beginning to produce.</p>

<p>There is a special and local reason why we should be
interested in the products of the high-warp tapestries in
the time of the greatest power of the Dukes of Burgundy.
It is that we can have the happy experience of studying,
in our own country, a set of these hangings, and this without
going farther than to the Metropolitan Museum of
Art in New York, where repose the set called <i>The Sacraments</i>.
(Plates facing pages <a href="#THE_SACRAMENTS01"><b>34</b></a>,
<a href="#THE_SACRAMENTS02"><b>38</b></a> and <a href="#THE_SACRAMENTS03"><b>39</b></a>.) There are
in all seven pieces, although the grounds are well taken
that the set originally included one more. They represent
the four Sacraments of Baptism, Marriage, Confirmation
and Extreme Unction, first by a series of ideal
representations, then by the everyday ceremonies of the
time&mdash;the time of Joan of Arc. Thus we have the early
Fifteenth Century folk unveiled to us in their ideals and
in their practicality. The one shows them to be religionists
of a high order, the other reveals a sumptuous and
elegant scale of living belonging to the nobility who made
resplendent those early times.</p>

<p>The drawing is full of simplicity and honesty, the composition
limited to a few individuals, each one having its
place of importance. In this, the early work differed
from the later, which multiplied figures until whole
groups counted no more than individuals. The background
is a field of conventionalised fleur-de-lis of so
large a pattern as not to interfere with the details thrown
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg&nbsp;39]</a></span>
against it. Scenes are divided by slender Gothic columns,
and other architectural features are tessellated floors
and a sketchy sort of brick-work that appears wherever
a limit-line is needed. It is the charming na&iuml;vet&eacute; of its
drawing that delights. Border there is none, but its lack
is never felt, for the pictures are of such interest that the
eye needs no barrier to keep it from wandering. Whatever
border is found is a varying structure of architecture
and of lettering and of the happy flowers of Gothic times
which thrust their charm into all possible and impossible
places.</p>

<p>The dress, in the suite of ideals, is created by the imagining
of the artist, admixed with the fashion of the day;
but in scenes portraying life of the moment, we are given
an interesting idea of how a bride &agrave; la mode was arrayed,
in what manner a gay young lord dressed himself on his
wedding morning, and how a young mother draped her
proud brocade. The colouring is that of ancient stained
glass, simple, rich, the gamut of colours limited, but the
manner of their combining is infinite in its power to
please. The conscientiousness of the ancient dyer lives
after him through the centuries, and the fresh ruby-colour,
the golden yellow of the large-figured brocades,
glow almost as richly now as they did when the Burgundian
dukes were marching up and down the land from
the Mediterranean, east of France, to the coast of
Flanders, carrying with them the woven pictures of their
ideals, their religion and their conquests. The weave is
smooth and even, speaking for the work of the tapissier
or weaver, although time has distorted the faces beyond
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg&nbsp;40]</a></span>
the lines of absolute beauty; and hatching accomplishes
the shading.</p>

<p>The repairer has been at work on this valuable set, not
the intelligent restorer, but the frank bungler who has
not hesitated to turn certain pieces wrong side out, nor
to set in large sections obviously cut from another tapestry.
It is surmised that the set contained one more piece&mdash;it
would be regrettable, indeed, if that missing square
had been cut up for repairs.</p>

<p>The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York owns
these tapestries through the altruistic generosity of J.
Pierpont Morgan, Esq. They are the most interesting
primitive work which are on public view in our country,
and awake to enthusiasm even the most insensate dullard,
who has a half hour to stand before them and realise all
they mean in art, in morals and in history.</p>

<p>To the lives of the Prophets and Saints we can always
turn; from the romance of men and women we can never
turn away. And so when a Gothic tapestry is found that
frankly omits Biblical folk and gives us a true picture
of men and women of the almost impenetrable time back
of the fifteen hundreds, tells us what they wore, in what
manner they comported themselves, that tapestry has a
sure and peculiar value. The surviving art of the Middle
Ages smacks strong of saints, paints at full length the
people of Moses&rsquo; time, but unhappily gives only a bust
of their contemporaries.</p>

<p>Hangings portraying secular subjects were less often
woven than those of religion and morals, but also the
former have less lustily outlived the centuries, owing to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg&nbsp;41]</a></span>
the habit of tearing them from the suspending hooks and
packing them about from ch&acirc;teau to ch&acirc;teau, to soften
surroundings for the wandering visitor. Thus it comes
that we have little tapestried record of a time when
knights and ladies and ill-assorted attributes walked hand
in hand, a time of chivalry and cruelty, of roses and war,
of sumptuousness and crudity, of privation and indulgence,
of simplicity and deceit.</p>

<p>If prowling among old books has tempted the hand to
take from the shelves one of those quaint luxuries known
as a &ldquo;Book of Hours,&rdquo; there before the eye lies the spirit
of that age in decoration and design. There, too, lies
much of the old spirit of morality&mdash;that, whether genuine
or affected, was bound to be expressed. Morality had a
vogue in those days, was a <i>sine qua non</i> of fashion. That
famous amateur Jean, duc de Berry, uncle of Charles VI
of France, had such a book, &ldquo;Les Tr&egrave;s Riches Heures&rdquo;;
one was possessed by that gifted Milanese lady whom
Ludovico Sforza put out of the line of Lombardy&rsquo;s throne.
The wonderful Gothic ingenuousness lies in their careful
paintings, the ingenuousness where virtue is expressed by
beauty, and vice by ugliness, and where, with delightful
seriousness, standing figures overtop the houses they
occupy&mdash;the same people, the same battlements, we have
seen on the early tapestries. Weavers must surely have
consulted the lovely books of Gothic miniature, so like is
the spirit of the designs to that in the Gothic fabrics.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The beauties of Agnes Sorel were represented on the
wool,&rdquo; says Jubinal, &ldquo;and she herself gave a superb and
magnificent tapestry to the church at Loches,&rdquo; but this
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg&nbsp;42]</a></span>
quaint student is doubtful if the lovely <i>amante du roi</i>
actually gave the tapestries that set forth her own beauties,
which beauty all can see in the quiet marble as she
lies sleeping with her spaniel curled up at her lovely feet
in the big ch&acirc;teau on the Loire.</p>

<p>By means of a rare set bought by the Rogers Fund for
the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, we can
see, if not the actual tapestries of fair Agnes Sorel, at least
those of the same epoch and manner. This set is called
<i>The Baill&eacute;e des Roses</i> and comprises three pieces, fragments
one is inclined to call them, seeing the mutilations
of the ages. (Plate facing page <a href="#LA_BAILLEE_DES_ROSES"><b>42</b></a>.) They were woven
probably before 1450, probably in France, undoubtedly
from French drawings, for the hand and eye of the artist
were evidently under the influence of the celebrated
miniaturist, Jean Fouquet of Tours. Childlike is the
charm of this careful artist of olden times, childlike is his
simplicity, his honesty, his care to retain the fundamental
virtues of a good little boy who lives to the tune of Eternal
Verities.</p>

<p>These three tapestries of the Roses illustrate so well so
many things characteristic of their day, that it is not time
lost to study them with an eye to all their points. There
is the weave, the wool, the introduction of metal threads,
the colour scale; all these besides the design and the story
it tells.</p>

<p>The tapestries represent a custom of France in the time
when Charles VII, the Indolent (and likewise through
Jeanne d&rsquo;Arc, the victorious) had as his favourite the
fascinating Agnes Sorel. During the late spring, when
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg&nbsp;43]</a></span>
the roses of France are in fullest flower, various peers of
France had as political duty to present to each member
of the Parliament a rose when the members answered in
response to roll call.</p>

<p>The great chamber where the body met was for the
occasion transformed into a bower; vines and sprays of
roses covered all the grim walls, as the straying vines in
the tapestry reveal. The host of the day, who might be
a foreign prince or cardinal, or one of the &ldquo;children of
France,&rdquo; began the day with giving a great breakfast
which took place in the several chambers. During the
feast the noble host paid a courtly visit to each chamber,
accompanied by a servitor who bore a huge salver on
which were the flowers and souvenirs to be presented.
The air was sweet with blossoms and pungent herbs, music
penetrated from the halls outside as the man of conspicuous
elegance played mock humility and served all with
the dainty tribute of a fragrant tender rose. This part
of the ceremony over, the company moved on to the great
audience chamber, where mass was said.</p>

<p>Our tapestries show the figures of ladies and gentlemen
present at this pretty ceremony&mdash;too pretty to associate
with desperate Jeanne d&rsquo;Arc, who at that very time was
rousing France to war to throw off the foreign yoke. The
ladies fair and masters bold are intensely human little
people, for the most part paired off in couples as men
and women have been wont to pair in gardens since
Eden&rsquo;s time. They are dressed in their best, that is evident,
and by their distant, courteous manners show good
society. The faces of the ladies are childlike, dutiful;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg&nbsp;44]</a></span>
those of the men more determined, after the manner of
men.</p>

<p>But the interest of the set centres in the tableau wherein
are but three figures, those of two men and a woman.
Here lies a piquant romance. Who is she, the grand
and gracious lady, bending like a lily stalk among the
roses, with a man on either side? A token is being exchanged
between her and the supplicant at her right.
He, wholly elegant, half afraid, bends the knee and fixes
her with a regard into which his whole soul is thrown.
She, fair lady, is inclining, yet withdrawing, eyes of fear
and modesty cast down. Yet whatever of temerity the
faces tell, the hands are carrying out a comedy. Hid in
the shadow of a copious hat, which the gentleman extends,
lurks a rose; proffered by the lady&rsquo;s hand is a token&mdash;fair
exchange, indeed, of lover&rsquo;s symbols&mdash;provided the strong,
hard man to the left of the lady has himself no right of
command over her and her favours. Thus might one
dream on forever over history&rsquo;s sweets and romance&rsquo;s gallantries.</p>

<p>It is across the sea, in the sympathetic Museum of
Cluny that the beauty of early French work is exquisitely
demonstrated. The set of <i>The Lady and the Unicorn</i> is
one of infinite charm. (Plates facing pages <a href="#LADY_AND_UNICORN01"><b>44</b></a>
and <a href="#LADY_AND_UNICORN02"><b>45</b></a>.)
In its enchanted wood lives a noble lady tall and fair,
lithe, young and elegant, with attendant maid and two
faithful, fabulous beasts that uphold the standards of
maidenhood. A simple circle denotes the boundary of
the enchanted land wherein she dwells, a park with noble
trees and lovely flowers, among which disport the little
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg&nbsp;45]</a></span>
animals that associate themselves with mankind. For
four centuries these hangings have delighted the eye of
man, and are perhaps more than ever appreciated now.
Certain it is that the art student&rsquo;s easel is often set before
them for copying the quaint design and soft colour.</p>

<p>As the early worker in wools could not forget the beauties
of earth, the foreground of many Gothic tapestries
is sprinkled with the loved common flowers of every day,
of the field and wood. This is one of the charming
touches in early tapestry, these little flowers that thrust
themselves with captivating inappropriateness into every
sort of scene. The grave and awesome figures in the
<i>Apocalypse</i> find them at their feet, and in scenes of battle
they adorn the sanguinary sod and twinkle between fierce
combatants.</p>

<p>Occasionally a weaver goes mad about them and refuses
to produce anything else but lily-bells newly sprung
in June, cowslips and daisies pied, rosemary and rue, and
all these in decorous courtesy on a deep, dark background
like twilight on a bank or moonlight in a dell&mdash;and lo,
we have the marvellous bit of nature-painting called
<i>millefleurs</i>.</p>

<p>A Burgundian tapestry that has come to this country to
add to our increasing riches, is the large hanging known
as <i>The Sack of Jerusalem</i>. (Plate facing page <a href="#SACK_OF_JERUSALEM"><b>46</b></a>.) Almost
more than any other it revivifies the ancient times of
Philip the Hardy, John without Fear, and Charles the
Bold, when these dukes, who were monarchs in all but
name, were leading lives that make our own Twentieth
Century fretting seem but the unrest of aspens. Such
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg&nbsp;46]</a></span>
hangings as this, <i>The Sack of Jerusalem</i>, were those that
the great Burgundian dukes had hung about their tents in
battle, their castles in peace, their fa&ccedil;ades and bridges in
f&ecirc;tes.</p>

<p>The subject chosen hints religion, but shouts bloodshed
and battle. Those who like to feel the texture of old
tapestries would find this soft and pliable, and in
wondrous state of preservation. Its colours are warm
and fresh, adhering to red-browns and brown-reds and
a general mellow tone differing from the sharp stained-glass
contrasts noticed in <i>The Sacraments</i>. Costumes
show a na&iuml;ve compromise between those the artist knew
in his own time and those he guessed to appertain to the
year of our Lord 70, when the scene depicted was actually
occurring. The tapestry resembles in many ways the
famous tapestries of the Duke of Devonshire which are
known as the Hardwick Hall tapestries. In drawing it
is similar, in massing, in the placing of spots of interest.
This large hanging is a part of the collection at the Metropolitan
Museum of Art in New York.</p>

<p>The Boston Museum of Fine Arts exhibits a primitive
hanging which is probably woven in France, Northern
France, at the end of the Fifteenth Century. (Plate
facing page <a href="#FRENCH_TAPESTRY"><b>40</b></a>.) It represents, in two panels, the power
of the church to drive out demons and to confound the
heathen. Fault can be found with its crudity of drawing
and weave, but tapestries of this epoch can hold a position
of interest in spite of faults.</p>

<p>A fine piece at the same museum is the long, narrow
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg&nbsp;47]</a></span>
hanging representing scenes from the life of Christ, with
a scene from Paradise to start the drama. (Plate facing
page <a href="#LIFE_OF_CHRIST"><b>41</b></a>.) This tapestry, which is of great beauty, is subdivided
into four panels by slender columns suggesting a
springing arch which the cloth was too low to carry. All
the pretty Gothic signs are here. The simple flowers upspringing,
the Gothic lettering, the panelling, and a narrow
border of such design as suggests rose-windows or
other lace-like carving. Here is noticeable, too, the
sumptuous brocades in figures far too large for the human
form to wear, figures which diminished greatly a very
few decades later.</p>

<p>The Institute of Art, Chicago, possesses an interesting
piece of the period showing another treatment of a similar
subject. (Plate facing page <a href="#SCENES_FROM_LIFE_OF_CHRIST"><b>48</b></a>.) In this the columns
are omitted, the planes are increased, and there is
an entire absence of the triptych or altar-piece style of
drawing which we associate with the primitive artists in
painting.</p>

<p>We have seen in this slight review that Paris was in a
fair way to cover the castle walls and floors of noble lords
with her high loom and <i>sarrazinois</i> products, when the
English occupation ruined the prosperity of the weaver&rsquo;s
guild. Arras supplied the enormous demand for tapestries
through Europe, and made a lasting fame. But this
little city, too, had to go down before the hard conditions
of the Conqueror. Louis XI, in 1477, possessed himself
of the town after the death of the last-famed Burgundian
duke, Charles the Bold, and under his eccentric persecutions
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg&nbsp;48]</a></span>
the guild of weavers scattered. He saw too late his
mistake. But other towns benefited by it, towns whither
the tapissiers fled with their art.</p>

<p>There had also been much trouble between the last
Duke of Burgundy and his Flemish cities. His extravagances
and expeditions led him to make extraordinary
demands upon one town and another for funds, and even
to make war upon them, as at Li&eacute;ge, the battles of which
conflict were perpetuated in tapestries. Let us trust that
no Li&eacute;gois weaver was forced to the humiliation of weaving
this set.</p>

<p>This disposition to work to his own ultimate undoing
was encouraged in the duke, wherever possible, by the
crafty Louis XI, who had his own reasons for wishing
the downfall of so powerful a neighbour. And thus it
came that Arras, the great tapestry centre, was at first
weakened, then destroyed by the capture of the town by
Louis XI immediately after the tragic death of the duke
in 1477.</p>

<p>Thus everything was favourable to the Brussels factories,
which began to produce those marvels of workmanship
that force from the world the sincerest admiration.
It is frankly asserted that toward the end of the century,
or more accurately, during the reigns of Charles VIII
and Louis XII (1483-1515), tapestry attained a degree
of perfection which has never been surpassed.</p>

<p>We have a very clear idea of what use to make of tapestries
in these days&mdash;to hang them in a part of the house
where they will be much seen and much protected, on
an important wall-space where their figures become the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg&nbsp;49]</a></span>
friend of daily life, or the bosky shades of their verdure
invite to revery. They are extended flat against the wall,
or even framed, that not one stroke of the artist&rsquo;s pencil
or one flash of the weaver&rsquo;s shuttle be hid. But, many
were their uses and grand were their purposes in the days
when high-warp and low-warp weaving was the important
industry of whole provinces. Palaces and castles
were hung with them, but apart from this was the sumptuous
use of a reserve of hangings for outdoor f&ecirc;tes and
celebrations of all sorts. These were the great opportunities
for all to exhibit their possessions and to make a
street look almost as elegant and habitable as the grandest
chamber of the king.</p>

<p>On the occasion of the entry of a certain queen into
Paris, all the way from Porte St. Denis to the Cathedral
of Notre Dame was hung with such specimens of the
weaver&rsquo;s art as would make the heart of the modern amateur
throb wildly. They were hung from windows,
draped across the fronts of the houses, and fluttered their
bright colours in the face of an illuminating sun that
yet had no power to fade the conscientious work of the
craftsman. The high lights of silk in the weave, and the
enrichment of gold and silver in the pattern caught and
held the sunbeams. In all the cavalcade of mounted
knights and ladies, there was the flashing of arms, the
gleam of jewelled bridles, the flaunting of rich stuffs,
all with a background of unsurpassed blending of colour
and texture. The bridge over the Seine leading to Notre
Dame, its ramparts were entirely concealed, its asperities
softened, by the tapestries which hung over its sides, making
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg&nbsp;50]</a></span>
the passage over the river like the approach to a
throne, the luxury of kings combined with the beauty of
the flowing river, the blue sky, the tender green of the
trees.</p>

<p>Indeed, it was so lovely a sight that the king himself
was not content to see it from his honoured but restricted
post, but needs must doff his crown&mdash;monarchs wore them
in those fairy days&mdash;and fling a leg over a gentleman&rsquo;s
charger, behind its owner, and thus ride double to see
the sights. So great was his eagerness to enjoy all the
display that he got a smart reproof from an officer of
ceremonies for trespassing.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>When Louis XI was the young king, and had not yet
developed the taste for bloodshed and torture that as a
crafty fox he used later to the horror of his nation, he,
too, had similar festivals with similar decorations. On
one occasion the Pont des Changes was made the chief
point in the royal progress through the streets of Paris.
The bridge was hung with superb tapestries of great size,
from end to end, and the king rode to it on a white
charger, his trappings set with turquoise, with a gorgeous
canopy supported over his head. Just as he reached the
bridge the air became full of the music of singing birds,
twenty-five hundred of them at that moment released,
and all fluttering, darting, singing amid the gorgeous
scene to tickle the fancy of a king.</p>

<h2 class="padtop">CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>HIGH GOTHIC</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE wonderful time of the Burgundian dukes is
gone; Charles le T&eacute;m&eacute;raire leaves the world at
Nancy, where the pitying have set up a cross in
memory of his unkingly death, and where the lover of
things Gothic may wander down a certain way to the
exquisite portico of the Ducal Palace and, entering, find
the Gothic room where the duke&rsquo;s precious tapestries
are hung. In this sympathetic atmosphere one may
dream away hours in sheer joy of association with these
shadowy hosts of the past, the relentless slayers in the
battle scenes, relentless moralists in the religious subjects&mdash;for
morality plays had a parallel in the morality tapestry,
issuing such rigid warnings to those who make merry
as is seen in <i>The Condemnation of Suppers and Banquets</i>,
<i>The Reward of Virtue</i>, <i>The Triumph of Right</i>, <i>The Horrors
of the Seven Deadly Sins</i>, all of which were popular
subjects for the weaver.</p>

<p>With the artists who might be called primitives we
have almost finished in the end of the Fifteenth Century.
The simplicity of the very early weavers passed. They
were content with comparatively few figures, and these
so strongly treated that in composition one scarce took
on more importance than another. When Arras and
other Flemish towns, as well as Paris and certain French
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg&nbsp;52]</a></span>
towns, developed the industry and employed more ambitious
artists, the designs became more crowded, and the
tendency was to multiply figures in an effort to crowd as
many as possible into the space. When architecture appeared
in the design, towers and battlements were
crowded with peeping heads in delightful lack of proportion,
and forests of spears springing from platoons
of soldiers, filled almost the entire height of the cloth.
The na&iuml;ve fashion still existed of dressing the characters
of an ancient Biblical or classic drama in costumes which
were the mode of the weaver&rsquo;s time, disregarding the
epoch in which the characters actually lived.</p>

<p>An adherence to the childlike drawing of the early
workers continues noticeable in their quaint way of putting
many scenes on one tapestry. Interiors are readily
managed, by dividing&mdash;as in <i>The Sacraments</i> set in the
Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York&mdash;with slender
Gothic columns, than which nothing could be prettier,
especially when framed in at the top with the Gothic
arch. In outdoor scenes the frank disregard of the probable
adds the charm of audacity. Side by side with a
scene of carnage, a field of blood with victims lying prone,
is inserted an island of flowers whereon youths and dogs
are pleasantly sporting; and adjoining that may be another
section cunningly introduced where a martyred
woman is enveloped in flames which spring from the
ground around her as naturally as grass in springtime.</p>

<p>And flowers, flowers everywhere. Those little blossoms
of the Gothic with their perennial beauty, they are
one of the smiles of that far time that shed cheer through
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg&nbsp;53]</a></span>
the centuries. They are not the grandiose affairs of the
Renaissance whose voluptuous development contains the
arrogant assurance of beauty matured. They do not
crown a column or trail themselves in foliated scrolls;
but are just as Nature meant them to be, unaffected bits
of colour and grace, upspringing from the sod. In the
cathedral at Berne is a happy example of the use of these
sweet flowers, as they appear at the feet of the sacred
group, and as they carry the eye into the sky by means
of the feathery branches like fern-fronds which tops the
scene; but we find them nearer home, in almost every
Gothic tapestry.</p>

<p>It was about the end of the last Crusade when Italy
began to produce the inspired artists who broke the bonds
of Byzantine traditions and turned back to the inspiration
of all art, which is Nature. Giotto, tending his sheep,
began to draw pictures of things as he saw them, Savonarola
awoke the conscience, Dante, Petrarch, Boccaccio&mdash;a
string of names to conjure with&mdash;all roused the intellect.
The dawn of the Renaissance flushed Europe with the
life of civilisation. But before the wonderful development
of art through the reversion to classic lines, came
a high perfection of the style called Gothic, and with that
we are pleased to deal first. It is so full of beauty to
the eye and interest to the intellect that sometimes we
must be dragged away from it to regard the softer lines
of later art, with the ingratitude and reluctance of childhood
when torn from its fairy tales to read of real people
in the commonplace of every day.</p>

<p>We are now in the time when the perfection of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg&nbsp;54]</a></span>
production was reached in the tapestries we call Gothic.
Artists had grown more certain of their touch in colour
and design, and weavers worked with such conscientious
care as is now almost unknown, and produced a quality
of tapestry superior to that of their forebears. The
Fifteenth Century and the first few years of the Sixteenth
were spent in perfecting the style of the preceding century,
and so great was the perfection reached, that it was
impossible to develop further on those lines.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed from their importance that
Brussels and Bruges were the sole towns of weavers.
There were many high-warp looms, and low-warp as
well, in many towns in Flanders and France, and there
were also beginnings in Spain, England and Germany.
Italy came later. The superb set in the Cluny Museum
in Paris, <i>The Lady and the Unicorn</i>, than which nothing
could be lovelier in poetic feeling as well as in technique,
is accorded to French looms. But as it is impossible in
a cursory survey to mention all, the two most important
cities are dwelt upon because it is from them that the
greatest amount of the best product emanated.</p>

<p>Tapestries could not well decline with the fortunes of
a town, for they were a heavy article of commerce at the
time when Louis XI attacked Arras. Trade was made
across the Channel, whence came the best wool for their
manufacture; they were bought by the French monarchs
and nobility; many drifted to Genoa and Italy, to be sold
by the active merchants of the times to whoever could
buy. When, therefore, Arras was crushed, her able
workmen flew to other centres of production, principally
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg&nbsp;55]</a></span>
in Flanders, notably to Bruges and Brussels, and helped
to bring these places into their high position.</p>

<p>Stories of kings and their magnificence breathe ever
of romance, but kings could not be magnificent were it
not for the labour of the conscientious common people,
those who go daily to their task, asking nothing better
than to live their little span in humble endeavour.
The weavers, the tapissiers of that far-away time in
Flanders are intensely appealing now when their beautiful
work hangs before us to-day. They send us a
friendly message down through the centuries. It is this
makes us inquire a bit into the conditions of their lives,
and so we find them scattered through the country north
of France working with single-hearted devotion toward
the perfection of their art. That they arrived there, we
know by such tapestries as are left us of their time.</p>

<p>Bruges was the home of a movement in art similar to
that occurring in Italy. Old traditions of painting were
being thrown aside&mdash;the revolution even attacking the
painter&rsquo;s medium, tempera, which was criticised, discarded
and replaced by oil on the palettes. Memling,
the brothers Van Eyck, were painting things as they saw
them, not as rules prescribed. Bernard Van Orley was
at work with bold originality.</p>

<p>It were strange if this Northern school of painters had
not influenced all art near by. It is to these men that
Brussels owes the beauty of her tapestries in that apogee
of Gothic art which immediately preceded the introduction
of the Renaissance from Italy.</p>

<p>Cartoons or drawings for tapestries took on the rules
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg&nbsp;56]</a></span>
of composition of these talented and original men. Easily
distinguishable is the strong influence of the religious
feeling, the fidelity to standards of the church. When
a rich townsman wished to express his praise or gratitude
to God, he ordered for the church an altar-piece or dainty
gilded Gothic carving to frame the painted panels of
careful execution. When Jean de Rome executed a cartoon,
he treated it in much the same way; built up an
airy Gothic structure and filled the spaces with pretty
pictures. The so-called Mazarin tapestry of Mr. Morgan&rsquo;s
shows this treatment at its best. Unhappily, the
atelier of Jean de Rome or Jan von Room is too sketchily
portrayed in the book of the past; its records are faint
and elusive. We only hear now and then an interested
allusion, a suggestion that this or that beautiful specimen
of work has come from his atelier.</p>

<p>Cartoons at the beginning of the Sixteenth Century
were not all divided into their different scenes by Gothic
column and arch. In much of the fine work there was
no division except a natural one, for the picture began to
develop the modern scheme of treating but one scene in
one picture. Although this might be filled with many
groups, yet all formed a harmonious whole. The practice
then fell into disuse of repeating the same individual
many times in one picture.</p>

<p>A good example of the change and improvement in
drawing which assisted in making Brussels&rsquo; supremacy
and in bringing Gothic art to perfection, is the fine hanging
in the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. (Plate
facing page <a href="#CROSSING_RED_SEA"><b>57</b></a>.) It depicts with beautiful na&iuml;vet&eacute; and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg&nbsp;57]</a></span>
much realism the discomfiture of Pharaoh and his army
floundering in the Red Sea, while the serene and elegant
children of Israel contemplate their distress with well-bred
calm from the flowery banks of an orderly park.</p>

<p>This tapestry illustrates so many of the important features
of work during the first period of Brussels&rsquo;
supremacy that it is to be lingered over, dissected and
tasted like a dessert of nuts and wine. Should one speak
first of the cartoon or of the weave, of the artist or of the
craftsmen? If it is to be the tapissier, then to him all
credit, for in this and similar work he has reached a care
in execution and a talent in translation that are inspired.
Such quantity of detail, so many human faces with their
varying expressions, could only be woven by the most
adroit tapissier.</p>

<p>The drawing shows, first, one scene of many groups
but a sole interest, with none but probable divisions.
Much grace and freedom is shown in the attitudes of the
persons on the shore, and strenuous effort and despair
among the engulfed soldiers. Extreme attention to detail,
the making one part as finished as another, even to
the least detail, is noticeable. The exaggerated patterns
of the stuffs observable in earlier work is absent, and a
sense of proportion is displayed in dress ornament. The
free movement of men and beasts, and the variety of
facial expression all show the immense strides made in
drawing and the perfection attained in this brilliant
period.</p>

<p>It was a time when the artist perfected the old style
and presaged the new, the years before the Renaissance
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg&nbsp;58]</a></span>
had left its cradle and marched over Europe. This perfection
of the Gothic ideal has a purity and simplicity
that can never fail to appeal to all who feel that sincerity
is the basic principle of art as it is of character. The
style of Quentin Matsys, of the Van Eycks, was the mode
at the end of the Fifteenth Century and the beginning of
the Sixteenth, and after all this lapse of time it seems to
us a sweet and natural expression of admirable human
attributes.</p>

<p>In the new wing of the Metropolitan Museum of Art,
New York, the labels of certain exhibits, purchases and
loans allude briefly to &ldquo;studio of Jean de Rome.&rdquo; It is an
allusion which especially interests us, as our country now
holds examples of this atelier which make us wish to
know more about its master. He was a designer in the
marvellous transition period of about 1500, when art
trembled between the restraint of ecclesiastic Gothic and
the voluptuous freedom of the Renaissance; hesitated between
the conventions of religion and the abandonment
to luxury, to indulgence of the senses. It is the fashion
to regard periods of transition as times of decadence, of
false standards of hybrid production, but at least they are
full of deepest interest to the student of design who finds
in the tremulous dawn of the new idea a flush which
beautifies the last years of the old method.</p>

<p>Attributed to this newly unearthed studio of Jean de
Rome hangs a marvellous tapestry in the new wing alluded
to, one which deserves repeated visits. (Plate facing
page <a href="#KINGDOM_OF_HEAVEN"><b>58</b></a>.) Indeed, to see it once creates the desire to
see it again, so beautiful is it in drawing and so exquisite
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg&nbsp;59]</a></span>
in colour and weave. It is suggested that Quentin
Matsys is responsible for the drawing, and it is known
that only Bruges or Brussels could produce such perfection
of textile. Indeed, Jean de Rome is by some authorities
spoken of as Jean de Brussels, for it is there that he
worked long and well, assisting to produce those wonders
of textile art that have never been surpassed, not even by
the Gobelins factory in the Seventeenth Century. The
tapestry in the Metropolitan Museum is now the property
of J. Pierpont Morgan, Esq., but began life as the
treasure of the King and Queen of Spain who, at the
time when Brussels was producing its best, were sitting
firmly on a throne but just wrested from the Saracenic
occupancy. Spain, while unable to establish famous
and enduring tapestry factories of her own, yet
was known always as a lavish buyer. Later, Cardinal
Mazarin, with his trained Italian eye, detected at once
the value of the tapestry and became possessed of it, counting
it among his best treasures of art. It is a woven representation
of the triptych, so favourite in the time of the
Van Eycks, and is almost as rich with gold as those ancient
altar decorations. The tapestry is variously called
<i>The Kingdom of Heaven</i>, and <i>The Adoration of the
Eternal Father</i> and is the most beautiful and important
of its kind in America. Fortunate they who can go to
the museum to see it&mdash;only less fortunate than those who
can go to see it many times.</p>

<p>In the private collection of Martin A. Ryerson, Esq.,
of Chicago, are three examples of great perfection. They
belonged to the celebrated art collection of Baron Spitzer,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg&nbsp;60]</a></span>
which fact, apart from their beauty, gives them renown.
The first of these (plate facing page <a href="#FLEMISH_TAPESTRY02"><b>60</b></a>) is an appearance
of Christ to the Magdalen after the Entombment,
and is Flemish work of late in the Fifteenth Century. It
is woven in silk and gold with infinite skill. With exquisite
patience the weaver has brought out the crowded
detail in the distance; indeed, it is this background,
stretching away to the far sky, past the Tomb, beyond
towns and plains of fruited trees to yet more cities set on
a hill, that constitutes the greatest charm of the picture,
and which must have brought hours of happy toil to the
inspired weaver.</p>

<p>The second tapestry of Mr. Ryerson&rsquo;s three pieces is also
Flemish of the late Fifteenth Century. (Plate facing
page <a href="#HOLY_FAMILY"><b>61</b></a>.) This small group of the Holy Family shows
at its best the conscientious work of the time, a time
wherein man regarded labour as a means of worshipping
his God. The subject is treated by both artist and weaver
with that loving care which approaches religion. The
holy three are all engaged in holding bunches of grapes,
while the Child symbolically spills their juice into a
chalice. Other symbols are found in the book and the
cross-surmounted globe. A background of flat drapery
throws into beautiful relief the inspired faces of the
group. Behind this stretches the miniature landscape,
but the foreground is unfretted by detail, abounding in
the repose of the simple surfaces of the garments of
Mother and Child. By a subtle trick of line, St. Joseph

add that the soul of the weaver also entered into the fabric.</p>

<p class="incaption">Flemish Tapestry, end of Fifteenth Century. Collection of Martin A. Ryerson,
Esq., Chicago. Formerly in the Spitzer Collection</p>

<p>The third piece from the Spitzer collection bears all
those marks of exquisite beauty with which Italy was
teeming in the Fifteenth Century. (Colour plate facing
page <a href="#THE_ANNUNCIATION"><b>82</b></a>.) Weavers from Brussels went down into Italy
and worked under the direction of Italian artists who
drew the designs. Andrea Mantegna was one of these.
The patron of the industry was the powerful Gonzaga
family. This tapestry of <i>The Annunciation</i> which Mr.
Ryerson is so fortunate as to hang in his collection, is
decorated with the arms of the Gonzaga family. The
border of veined marble, the altar of mosaics and fine
relief, the architecture of the outlying baptistry, the
wreathed angel, all speak of Italy in that lovely moment
when the Gothic had not been entirely abandoned and
the Renaissance was but an opening bud.</p>

<p>The highest work of painter and weaver&mdash;artists both&mdash;continued
through thirty or forty years. Pity it is, the
time had not been long enough for more remains of it to
have come to us than those that scantily supply museums.
After the Gothic perfection came the great change made
in Flanders by the introduction of the Renaissance.</p>

<p>It came through the excellence of the weavers. It was
not the worth of the artists that brought Brussels its greatest
fame, but the humbler work of its tapissiers. Their
lives, their endeavours counted more in textile art than
did the Flemish school of painting. No such weavers
existed in all the world. They were bound together as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg&nbsp;62]</a></span>
a guild, had restrictions and regulations of their own that
would shame a trades union of to-day, and in change of
politics had scant consideration from new powers. But
in the end they were the ones to bring fame to the Brussels
workshops.</p>

<p>In 1528 they were banded together by organisation,
and from that time on their work is easily followed and
identified. It was in that year that a law was made compelling
weavers&mdash;and allowing weavers&mdash;to incorporate
into the encompassing galloon of the tapestry the Brussels
Brabant mark of two B&rsquo;s with a shield between. And it
was about this time and later that the celebrated family
of weavers named Pannemaker came into prominence
through the talent of Wilhelm de Pannemaker, he who
accompanied the Emperor Charles V on his expedition
to Tunis.</p>

<p>This expedition flaunts itself in the set of tapestries
now in Madrid. (Plate facing page <a href="#CONQUEST_OF_TUNIS"><b>62</b></a>.) The emperor
seems, from our point of view, to have done it all with
dramatic forethought. There was his special artist on
the spot, Jan Vermeyen, to draw the superb cartoons, and
accompanying him was Wilhelm de Pannemaker, the
ablest weaver of his day, to set the loom and thrust the
shuttle. Granada was the place selected for the weaving,
and the finest of wool was set aside for it, besides lavish
amounts of silk, and pounds of silver and gold. In three
years, by the help of eighty workmen, Pannemaker completed
his colossal task. Such was the master-weaver of
the Sixteenth Century.</p>

<h2 class="padtop">CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>RENAISSANCE INFLUENCE</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">B</span>RUSSELS in 1515, with her workmen at the
zenith of their perfection, was given the order to
weave the set of the <i>Acts of the Apostles</i> for the
Pope to hang in the Sistine Chapel. (Plate facing page
<a href="#DEATH_OF_ANANIAS"><b>64</b></a>.) The cartoons were by the great Raphael. Not
only did he draw the splendid scenes, but with his exquisite
invention elaborated the borders. Thus was set in
the midst of the Brussels ateliers a pattern for the new
art that was to retire the nice perfection of the previous
school of restraint. From that time, all was regulated
by new standards.</p>

<p>Before considering the change that came to designs
in tapestry, it is necessary that both mind and eye should
be literally savants in the Gothic. Without this the
greatest point in classifying and distinguishing is missed.
The dainty grace of the verdure and flowers, the exquisite
models of the architectural details, the honest, simple
scheme of colour, all these are distinguishing marks, but
to them is added the still greater one of the figures and
their grouping. In the very early work, these are few
in number, all equally accented in size and finish, but
later the laws of perspective are better understood, and
subordinates to the subject are drawn smaller. This gives
opportunity for increase in the number of personages, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg&nbsp;65]</a></span>
for the introduction of the horses and dogs and little wild
animals that cause a childish thrill of delight wherever
they are encountered, so like are they to the species that
haunt childhood&rsquo;s fairyland.</p>

<p>Indeed, the Gothic tapestries more than any other existing
pictures take us back to that epoch of our lives when
we lived in romance, when the Sleeping Beauty hid in
just such towers, when the prince rode such a horse and
appeared an elegant young knight. The inscrutable
mystery of those folk of other days is like the inscrutable
mystery of that childhood time, the Medi&aelig;val time of the
imagination, and those of us who remember its joys gaze
silent and happy in the tapestry room of the Ducal Palace
at Nancy, or in Mary&rsquo;s Chamber at Holyrood, or in
any place whatever where hang the magic pictured
cloths.</p>

<p>When the highest development of a style is reached
a change is sure to come. It may be a degeneration, or
it may be the introduction of a new style through some
great artistic impulse either native or introduced by contact
with an outside influence. Fortunately, the Gothic
passed through no pallid process of deterioration. The
examples that nest comfortably in the museums of the
world or in the homes of certain fortunate owners, do
not contain marks of decadence&mdash;only of transition. It
is a style that was replaced, but not one that died the
death of decadence.</p>

<p>It is with reluctance that one who loves the Gothic
will leave it for the more recent art of the Renaissance.
Its charm is one that embodies chasteness, grace, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg&nbsp;66]</a></span>
simplicity, one that is so exquisitely finished, and so individual
that the mind and eye rest lovingly upon its decorative
expressions. It is averred that the introduction of the
revived styles of Greece and Rome into France destroyed
an art superior. One is inclined to this opinion in studying
a tapestry of the highest Gothic expression, a finished
product of the artist and the craftsman, both having given
to its execution their honest labour and highest skill. Unhappily
it is often, with the tapestry lover, a case similar
to that of the penniless boy before the bakeshop window&mdash;you
may look, but you may not have,&mdash;for not
often are tapestries such as these for sale. Only among
the experienced dealer-collectors is one fortunate enough
to find these rare remnants of the past which for colour,
design and texture are unsurpassed.</p>

<p>But the Gothic was bound to give way as a fashion
in design. Politics of Europe were at work, and men
were more easily moving about from one country to
another. The cities of the various provinces over which
the Burgundian dukes had ruled were prevented by
natural causes, from being united. Arras, Ghent, Li&eacute;ge
instead of forming a solidarity, were separate units of
interest. This made the subjugation of one or the other
an easy matter to the tyrant who oppressed. As Arras
declined under the misrule of Charles le T&eacute;m&eacute;raire
(whose possessions at one time outlined the whole northern
and eastern border of France) Brussels came into
the highest prominence as a source of the finest tapestries.</p>

<p>The great change in tapestries that now occurs is the
same that altered all European art and decoration and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg&nbsp;67]</a></span>
architecture. Indeed it cannot be limited to these evidences
alone, for it affected literature, politics, religion,
every intellectual evidence. Man was breaking his bonds
and becoming freed for centuries to come. The time
was well-named for the new birth. Like another Birth
of long ago, it occurred in the South, and its influence
gradually spread over the entire civilised world. The
Renaissance, starting in Italy, gradually flushed the whole
of Europe with its glory. Artists could not be restrained.
Throbbing with poetry to be expressed, they threw off
design after design of inspired beauty and flooded the
world with them. The legitimate field of painting was
not large enough for their teeming originality which pre-empted
also the field of decorative design as well. Many
painters apprenticed themselves to goldsmiths and silversmiths
to become yet more cunning in the art of minute
design, and the guilds of Florence held the names best
known in the fine arts.</p>

<p>Tapestry weaving seems a natural expression in the
North, the impulsive supplying of a local need. Possibly
Italy felt no such need throughout the Middle Ages.
However that may be, when her artists composed designs
for woven pictures there were no permanent artisans at
home of sufficient skill to weave them.</p>

<p>But up in the North, craftsmen were able to produce
work of such brilliant and perfect execution that the great
artists of Italy were inspired to draw cartoons. And
so it came, that to make sure of having their drawings
translated into wool and silk with proper artistic feeling,
the cartoons of Raphael were bundled off by trusty
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg&nbsp;68]</a></span>
carriers to the ateliers of Flanders. Thus Italy got her
tapestries of the Renaissance, and thus Flanders acquired
by inoculation the rich art of the Renaissance.</p>

<p>The direct cause of the change in Flemish style of
tapestries was in this way brought about by the Renaissance
of Italy. New rules of drawing were dominating.
Changes were slower when travelling was difficult, and
the average of literacy was low; but gradually there came
creeping up to Brussels cartoon after cartoon in the new
method, for her skilled workmen to transpose into wool
and silk and metal, &ldquo;thread of Arras,&rdquo; and &ldquo;gold and
silver of Cyprus.&rdquo; Italy had the artists, Brussels had the
craftsmen&mdash;what happier combination could be made
than the union of these two? Thus was the great change
brought about in tapestries, and this union is the great
fact to be borne in mind about the difference between the
Gothic tapestries and those which so quickly succeeded
them.</p>

<p>From now on the old method is abandoned, not only in
Brussels, but everywhere that the high-warp looms are
set up. The &ldquo;art nouveau&rdquo; of that day influenced every
brush and pencil. The great crowding of serried hosts
on a single field disappeared, and fewer but perfect figures
played their parts on the woven surface. Wherever
architectural details, such as porticoes or columns, were
introduced, these dropped the old designs of &ldquo;pointed&rdquo;
style or battlements, and took on the classic or the high
Renaissance that ornaments the fa&ccedil;ade of Pavia&rsquo;s Certosa.
One by one the wildwood flowers receded before
the advance of civilisation, very much as those in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg&nbsp;69]</a></span>
veritable land are wont to do, and their place was taken
by a verdure as rich as the South could produce, with
heavy foliage and massive blossoms.</p>

<p>It is impossible to overestimate the importance to Brussels
of the animating experience and distinguished commission
of executing the set of tapestries for the Sistine
Chapel after cartoons by Raffaelo Sanzio. The date is
one to tie to (1515) and the influence of the work was
far-reaching. The Gothic method could no longer continue.</p>

<p>The Renaissance spread its influence, established its
standards and introduced that wave of productiveness
which always followed its introduction. There are many
who doubt the superiority of the voluptuous art of the
high Renaissance. There are those who prefer (perhaps
for reasons of sentiment) the early Gothic, and many
more who love far better the sweet purity of the early
Renaissance. Before us Raphael presents his full figures
replete with action, rich with broad, open curves in
nudity, and magnificent with lines of flowing drapery.
To him be accorded all due honour; but, if it is the privilege
of the artist&rsquo;s spirit to wander still on earth, he must
find his particular post-mortem punishment in viewing
the deplorable school of exaggeration which his example
founded. Who would not prefer one of the chaste
tapestries of perfected Gothic to one of those which followed
Raphael, imitating none of his virtues, exaggerating
his faults? It is these followers, the virilities of
whose false art is as that of weeds, who have come almost
to our own day and who have succeeded in spoiling the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg&nbsp;70]</a></span>
historical aspect of the New Testament for many an
imaginative Sunday-school attendant by giving us Bible
folk in swarthy undress, in lunatic beards and in unwearable
drapings. These terrible persons, descendants of
Raphael&rsquo;s art, can never stir a human sympathy.</p>

<p>Just here a word must be said of the workmen, the
weavers of Brussels. For them certain fixed rules were
made, but also they were allowed much liberty in execution.
The artist might draw the big cartoons and thus
become the governing influence, but much of the choice
of colour and thread was left to the weaver. This made
of him a more important factor in the composition than
a mere artisan; he was, in fact, an artist, must needs be,
to execute a work of such sublimity as the Raphael set.</p>

<p>And as a weaver, his patience was without limit.
Thread by thread, the warp was set, and thread by thread
the woof was woven and coerced into place by the relentless
comb of the weaver. Perhaps a man might make
a square foot, by a week of close application; but &ldquo;how
much&rdquo; mattered nothing&mdash;it was &ldquo;how well&rdquo; that counted.
Haste is disassociable from labour of our day; we might
produce&mdash;or reproduce&mdash;tapestries as good as the old,
but some one is in haste for the hanging, and excellency
goes by the board. The weaver of those days of perfection
was content to be a weaver, felt his ambition gratified
if his work was good.</p>

<p>Peter van Aelst was the master chosen to execute the
Raphael tapestries, and the pieces were finished in three
or four years. Those who think present-day prices high,
should think on the fact that Pope Leo X paid $130,000
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg&nbsp;71]</a></span>
for the execution of the tapestries, which in 1515 counted
for more than now. Raphael received $1,000 each for
the cartoons, almost all of which are now guarded in
England. The tapestries after a varied history are resting
safely in the Vatican, a wonder to the visitor.</p>

<p>When Van Aelst had finished his magnificent work, the
tapestries were sent to Rome. Those who go now to the
Sistine Chapel to gaze upon Michael Angelo&rsquo;s painted
ceiling, and the panelled sidewalls of Botticelli and other
cotemporary artists, are more than intoxicated with the
feast. But fancy what the scene must have been when
Pope Leo X summoned his gorgeous guard and cardinals
around him in this chapel enriched also with the splendour
of these unparalleled hangings.</p>

<p>And thus it came that Italy held the first place&mdash;almost
the only place&mdash;in design, and Brussels led in manufacture.</p>

<p>In 1528 appeared a mark on Brussels&rsquo; tapestries which
distinguished them from that time on. Prior to that their
works, except in certain authenticated instances, are not
always distinguishable from those of other looms&mdash;of
which many existed in many towns. The mark alluded
to is the famous one of two large B&rsquo;s on either side of a
shield or scutcheon. This was woven into a plain band
on the border, and the penalty for its misuse was the no
small one of the loss of the right hand&mdash;the death of the
culprit as a weaver. This mark and its laws were intended
to discourage fraud, to promote perfection and to
conserve a high reputation for weavers as well as for
dealers.</p>

<h3>RENAISSANCE TO RUBENS</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>HEN the Raphael cartoons first came to Brussels
the new method was a little difficult for
the tapissier. His hand had been accustomed
to another manner. He had, too, been allowed much liberty
in his translations&mdash;if one may so call the art of
reproducing a painted model on the loom. He might
change at will the colour of a drapery, even the position of
a figure, and, most interesting fact, he had on hand a supply
of stock figures that he might use at will, making for
himself suitable combination. The figures of Adam and
Eve gave a certain cachet to hangings not entirely secular
and these were slipped in when a space needed filling.
There were also certain lovely ladies who might at one
time play the r&ocirc;le of attendant at a feast <i>al fresco</i>, at
another time a character in an allegory. The weaver&rsquo;s
hand was a little conventional when he began to execute
the Raphael cartoons, but during the three years required
for their execution he lost all restriction and was ready
for the freer manner.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed the Flemish artists were content
to let the Italians entirely usurp them in the drawing
of cartoons. The lovely refinement of the Bruges
school having been thrust aside, the Fleming tried his
hand at the freer method, not imitating its classicism but
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg&nbsp;73]</a></span>
giving his themes a broader treatment. The Northern
temperament failed to grasp the spirit of the South, and
figures grew gross and loose in the exaggerated drawing.
Borders, however, show no such deterioration; the attention
to detail to which the old school was accustomed
was here continued and with good effect. No stronger
evidence is needed than some of these half savage portrayals
of life in the Sixteenth Century to declare the
classic method an exotic in Flanders.</p>

<p>But with the passing of the old Gothic method, there
was little need for other cartoonists than the Italian, so
infinitely able and prolific were they. Andrea del Sarto,
Titian, Paolo Veronese, Giulio Romano, these are among
the artists whose work went up to Brussels workshops
and to other able looms of the day. We can fancy
the fair face of Andrea&rsquo;s wife being lovingly caressed
by the weaver&rsquo;s fingers in his work; we can imagine the
beauties of Titian, the sumptuousness of Veronese&rsquo;s
feasts, and the fat materialism of Giulio Romano&rsquo;s heavy
cherubs, all contributing to the most beautiful of textile
arts.</p>

<p>Still earlier, Mantegna supplied a series of idealised
Pompeian figures exquisitely composed, set in a lacy
fancy of airy architectural detail, in which he idealised
all the gods of Olympus. Each fair young goddess, each
strong and perfect god, stood in its particular niche and
indicated its <i>penchant</i> by a tripod, a peacock, an apple
or a caduceus, as clue to the proper name. Such airy
beauty, such dainty conception, makes of the gods rulers of
&aelig;sthetics, if not of fate. This series of Mantegna was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg&nbsp;74]</a></span>
the inspiration two centuries later of the <i>Triumphs of
the Gods</i>, and similar hangings of the newly-formed
Gobelins.</p>

<p>Giulio Romano drew, among other cartoons, a set of
<i>Children Playing</i>, which were the inspiration later at the
Gobelins for Lebrun&rsquo;s <i>Enfants Jardiniers</i>.</p>

<p>As classic treatment was the mode in the Sixteenth
Century, so classic subject most appealed. The loves and
adventures of gods and heroes gave stories for an infinite
number of sets. As it was the fashion to fill a room with
a series, not with miscellaneous and contrasting bits, several
tapestries similar in subject and treatment were a
necessity. The gods were carried through their adventures
in varying composition, but the borders in all the
set were uniform in style and measurement.</p>

<p>In those prolific days, when ideas were crowding fast
for expression, the border gave just the outlet necessary
for the superfluous designs of the artist. He was wont
to plot it off into squares with such architectonic fineness
as Mina da Fiesole might have used, and to make of
each of these a picture or a figure so perfect that in
itself it would have sufficient composition for an entire
tapestry. All honour to such artists, but let us never
once forget that without the skill and talent of the
master-weaver these beauties would never have come
down to us.</p>

<p>The collection of George Blumenthal, Esquire, of New
York, contains as beautiful examples of Sixteenth Century
composition and weaving as could be imagined.
Two of these were found in Spain&mdash;the country which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg&nbsp;75]</a></span>
has ever hoarded her stores of marvellous tapestries.
They represent the story of <i>Mercury</i>. (<a href="#HERSE_AND_MERCURY"><b>Frontispiece.</b></a>)
The cartoon is Italian, and so perfect is its drawing, so
rich in invention is the exquisite border, that the name of
Raphael is half-breathed by the thrilled observer. But
if the artist is not yet certainly identified, the name of
the weaver is certain, for on the galloon he has left his
sign. It is none other than the celebrated Wilhelm de
Pannemaker.</p>

<p>In addition to this is the shield and double B of the
Brussels workshop, which after 1528 was a requirement
on all tapestries beyond a certain small size. In 1544
the Emperor Charles V made a law that the mark or
name of the weaver and the mark of his town must be
put in the border. It was this same Pannemaker of the
Blumenthal tapestries who wove in Spain the <i>Conquest
of Tunis</i> for Charles V. (Plate facing page <a href="#CONQUEST_OF_TUNIS"><b>62</b></a>.)</p>

<p>Mr. Blumenthal&rsquo;s tapestries must have carried with
them some such contract for fine materials as that which
attended the execution of the <i>Tunis</i> set, so superb are
they in quality. Indeed, gold is so lavishly used that
the border seems entirely made of it, except for the delicate
figures resting thereon. It is used, too, in an unusual
manner, four threads being thrown together to
make more resplendent the weave.</p>

<p>The beauty of the cartoon as a picture, the decorative
value of the broad surfaces of figured stuffs, the marvellous
execution of the weaver, all make the value of these
tapestries incalculable to the student and the lover of
decorative art. Mr. Blumenthal has graciously placed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg&nbsp;76]</a></span>
them on exhibition in the Metropolitan Museum of Art,
New York. Fortunate they who can absorb their beauty.</p>

<p>That treasure-house in Madrid which belongs to the
royal family contains a set which bears the same ear-marks
as the Blumenthal tapestries. It is the set called
<i>The Loves of Vertumnus and Pomona</i>. (Plates facing
pages <a href="#VERTUMNUS_AND_POMONA01"><b>72</b></a>, <a href="#VERTUMNUS_AND_POMONA02"><b>73</b></a>,
<a href="#VERTUMNUS_AND_POMONA03"><b>74</b></a> and <a href="#VERTUMNUS_AND_POMONA04"><b>75</b></a>.) Here is the same manner of
dress, the same virility, the same fulness of decoration.
Yet the Mercury is drawn with finer art.</p>

<p>The delight in perfected detail belonging to the Italian
school of artists resulted in an arrangement of <i>grotesques</i>.
Who knows that the goldsmith&rsquo;s trade was not
responsible for these tiny fantastics, as so many artists
began as apprentices to workers in gold and silver? This
evidence of talented invention must be observed, for it
set the fashion for many a later tapestry, notably the
<i>Grotesque Months</i> of the Seventeenth Century. Mingled
with verdure and fruit, it is seen in work of the Eighteenth
Century. But in its original expression is it the most
talented. There we find that intellectual plan of design,
that building of a perfect whole from a subtle combination
of absolutely irreconcilable and even fabulous objects.
Yet all is done with such beguiling art that both
mind and eye are piqued and pleased with the impossible
blending of realism and imagination.</p>

<p>Bacchiacca drew a filigree of attenuated fancies, threw
them on a ground of single delicate colour, and sent them
for weave to the celebrated masters, John Rost and Nicholas
Karcher. (Plates facing pages <a href="#ITALIAN_TAPESTRY01"><b>84</b></a>
and <a href="#ITALIAN_TAPESTRY02"><b>85</b></a>.) These

Italy.</p>

<p class="incaption">Brussels Tapestry. Sixteenth Century. Collection of Arthur Astor Carey,
Esq., Boston</p>

<p>And so it came that the Renaissance swept all before
it in the world of tapestry. More than that, with the
increase of culture and of wealth, with the increased
mingling of the peoples of Europe after the raid of
Charles V into Italy, the demand for tapestries enormously
increased. They were wanted for furnishing of
homes, they were wanted as gifts&mdash;to brides, to monarchs,
to ambassadors. And they were wanted for splendid
decoration in public festivals. They had passed beyond
the stage of rarity and had become almost as much a
matter of course as clothing.</p>

<p>Brussels being in the ascendency as a producer, the
world looked to her for their supply, and thereby came
trouble. More orders came than it was possible to fill.
The temptation was not resisted to accept more work than
could be executed, for commercialism has ever a hold.
The result was a driving haste. The director of the
ateliers forced his weavers to quick production. This
could mean but one thing, the lessening of care in every
department.</p>

<p>Gradually it came about that expedition in a tapissier,
the ability to weave quickly, was as great a desideratum
as fine work. Various other expedients were resorted to
beside the Sixteenth Century equivalent of &ldquo;Step lively.&rdquo;
Large tapestries were not set on a single loom, but
were woven in sections, cunningly united when finished.
In this manner more men could be impressed into the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg&nbsp;78]</a></span>
manufacture of a single piece. A wicked practice was
introduced of painting or dyeing certain woven parts in
which the colours had been ill-selected.</p>

<p>All these things resulted in constantly increasing restrictions
by the guild of tapissiers and by order of royal
patrons. But fraud is hard to suppress when the animus
of the perpetrator is wrong. Laws were made to stop
one fault after another, until in the end the weavers were
so hampered by regulations that work was robbed of all
enthusiasm or originality.</p>

<p>It was at this time that Brussels adopted the low-warp
loom. In other words, after a brilliant period of prolific
and beautiful production, Brussels began to show signs
of deterioration. Her hour of triumph was past. It had
been more brilliant than any preceding, and later times
were never able to touch the same note of purity coupled
with perfection. The reason for the decline is known,
but reasons are of scant interest in the face of the deplorable
fact of decadence.</p>

<p>The Italian method of drawing cartoons was adopted
by the Flemish cartoonists at this time, but as it was an
adoption and not a natural expression of inborn talent,
it fell short of the high standard of the Renaissance. But
that is not to say that we of to-day are not ready to worship
the fruit of the Italian graft on Flemish talent. A
tapestry belonging to the Institute of Art in Chicago well
represents this hybrid expression of drawing. (Plate
facing page <a href="#BRUSSELS_TAPESTRY"><b>78</b></a>.) The principal figures are inspired by
such as are seen in the <i>Mercury</i> of Mr. Blumenthal&rsquo;s collection,
or the <i>Vertumnus and Pomona</i> series, but there
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg&nbsp;79]</a></span>
the artist stopped and wandered off into his traditional
Flemish landscape with proper Flemings in the background
dressed in the fashion of the artist&rsquo;s day.</p>

<p class="incaption">Brussels Tapestry. Woven by Gerard van den Strecken. Cartoon attributed

<p>The border was evidently inspired by Raphael&rsquo;s classic
figures and arabesques, but the column of design is na&iuml;vely
broken by the far perspective of a formal garden. The
Italian cartoonist would have built his border, figure and
arabesque, one above another like a fantastic column
(<i>vide</i> Mr. Blumenthal&rsquo;s <i>Mercury</i> border). The Fleming
saw the intricacy, the multiplied detail, but missed
the intellectual harmony. But, such trifles apart, the
Flemish examples of this style that have come to us are
thrilling in their beauty of colour, and borders such as
this are an infinite joy. This tapestry was woven about
the last quarter of the Sixteenth Century by a weaver
named Jacques Geubels of Brussels, who was employed
by Carlier, a merchant of Antwerp.</p>

<p>As the fruit of the Renaissance graft on Flanders coarsened
and deteriorated, a new influence arose in the Low
Countries, one that was bound to submerge all others.
Rubens appeared and spread his great decorative surfaces
before eyes that were tired of hybrid design. This great
scene-painter introduced into all Europe a new method
in his voluptuous, vigorous work, a method especially
adapted to tapestry weaving. It is not for us to quarrel
with the art of so great a master. The critics of painting
scarce do that; but in the lesser art of tapestry the change
brought about by his cartoons was not a happy one.</p>

<p>His great dramatic scenes required to be copied directly
from the canvas, no liberty of line or colour could
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg&nbsp;80]</a></span>
be allowed the weaver. In times past, the tapissier&mdash;with
talent almost as great as that of the cartoonist&mdash;altered
at his discretion. Even he to whom the Raphael
cartoons were entrusted changed here and there the work
of the master.</p>

<p>But now he was expected to copy without license for
change. In other words, the time was arriving when
tapestries were changing from decorative fabrics into
paintings in wool. It takes courage to avow a distaste
for the newer method, seeing what rare and beautiful
hangings it has produced. But after a study of the purely
decorative hangings of Gothic and Renaissance work, how
forced and false seem the later gods. The value of the
tapestries is enormous, they are the work of eminent men&mdash;but
the heart turns away from them and revels again
in the Primitives and the Italians of the Cinque Cento.</p>

<p>Repining is of little avail. The mode changes and
tastes must change with it. If the gradual decadence
after the Renaissance was deplorable, it was well that a
Rubens rose in vigour to set a new and vital copy. To
meet new needs, more tones of colour and yet more, were
required by the weaver, and thus came about the making
of woven pictures.</p>

<p>As one picture is worth many pages of description, it
were well to observe the examples given (plate facing
page <a href="#MEETING_OF_ANTONY_AND_CLEOPATRA"><b>79</b></a>) of the superb set of <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>, a
series of designs attributed to Rubens, executed in Brussels
by Gerard van den Strecken. This set is in the Metropolitan
Museum of Art, New York.</p>

<h2 class="padtop">CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>ITALY</h3>

<h4>FIFTEENTH THROUGH SEVENTEENTH CENTURIES</h4>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE history of tapestry in Italy is the story of the
great families, their romances and achievements.
These families were those which furnished rulers
of provinces&mdash;kings, almost&mdash;which supplied popes as
well, and folk who thought a powerful man&rsquo;s pleasurable
duty was to interest himself seriously in the arts.</p>

<p>With the fine arts all held within her hand, it was but
logical that Italy should herself begin to produce the
tapestries she was importing from the land of the barbarians
as those beyond her northern borders were arrogantly
called. First among the records is found the name
of the Gonzaga family which called important Flemish
weavers down to Mantua, and there wove designs of
Mantegna, in the highest day of their factory&rsquo;s production,
about 1450.</p>

<p>Duke Frederick of Urbino is one of the early Italian
patrons of tapestry whose name is made unforgettable in
this connexion by the product of the factory he established
toward the end of the Fifteenth Century, at his court in
the little duchy which included only the space reaching
from the Apennines to the Adriatic and from Rimini to
Ancona. The chief work of this factory was the <i>History
of Troy</i> which cost the generous and enthusiastic duke a
hundred thousand dollars.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg&nbsp;82]</a></span>
The great d&rsquo;Este family was one to follow persistently
the art, possibly because it habited the northern part of
the peninsula and was therefore nearer Flanders, but more
probably because the great Duke of Ferrara was animated
by that superb pride of race that chafes at rivalry; this,
added to a wish to encourage art, and the lust of possession
which characterised the great men of that day.</p>

<p>It was the middle of the Sixteenth Century that Ercole
II, the head of the d&rsquo;Este family, revived at Ferrara the
factory of his family which had suffered from the wars.
The master-weavers were brought from Flanders, not only
to produce tapestries almost unequalled for technical perfection,
but to instruct local weavers. These two important
weavers were Nicholas and John Karcher or Carcher
as it is sometimes spelled, names of great renown&mdash;for a
weaver might be almost as well known and as highly esteemed
as the artist of the cartoons in those days when
artisan&rsquo;s labour had not been despised by even the great
Leonardo. The foremost artist of the Ferrara works was
chosen from that city, Battista Dosso, but also active as
designer was the Fleming, Lucas Cornelisz. In Dosso&rsquo;s
work is seen that exquisite and dainty touch that characterises
the artists of Northern Italy in their most perfect
period, before voluptuous masses and heavy scroll-like
curves prevailed even in the drawing of the human figure.</p>

<p>The House of Este had a part to play in the visit of the
Emperor Charles V when he elected to be crowned with
Lombardy&rsquo;s Iron Crown, in 1530, at Bologna instead of
in the cathedral at Monza where the relic has its home.
&ldquo;Crowns run after me; I do not run after them,&rdquo; he said,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg&nbsp;83]</a></span>
with the arrogance of success. At this reception at
Bologna we catch a glimpse of the brilliant Isabella
d&rsquo;Este amid all the magnificence of the occasion. It
takes very little imagination to picture the effect of the
public square at Bologna&mdash;the same buildings that stand
to-day&mdash;the square of the Palazzo Publico and the Cathedral&mdash;to
fancy these all hung with the immense woven
pictures with high lights of silk and gold glowing in the
sun, and through this magnificent scene the procession
of mounted guards, of beautiful ladies, of church dignitaries,
with Charles V as the central object of pomp, wearing
as a clasp to the cope of state the great diamond found
on the field of Marat after the defeat of the Duke of
Burgundy. The members of the House of Este were
there with their courts and their prot&eacute;g&eacute;s, their artists
and their literati, as well as with their display of riches
and gaiety.</p>

<p>The manufactory at Ferrara was now allowed to sell
to the public, so great was its success, and to it is owed
the first impetus given to the weaving in Italy and the
production of some of the finest hangings which time has
left for us to enjoy to-day. It is a sad commentary on
man&rsquo;s lust of novelty that the factory at Ferrara was ultimately
abandoned by reason of the introduction into the
country of the brilliant metal-illuminated leathers of
Cordova. The factory&rsquo;s life was comprised within the
space of the years 1534 to 1597, the years in which lived
Ercole II and Alfonso II, the two dukes of the House of
Este who established and continued it.</p>

<p>It was but little wonder that the great family of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg&nbsp;84]</a></span>
Medici looked with envious eyes on any innovation or
success which distinguished a family which so nearly approached
in importance its own. When Ercole d&rsquo;Este
had fully proved the perfection of his new industry, the
weaving of tapestry, one of the Medici established for
himself a factory whereby he, too, might produce this
form of art, not only for the furtherance of the art, but
to supply his own insatiable desires for possession.</p>

<p>The <i>Arazzeria Medicea</i> was the direct result of the
jealousy of Cosimo I, Grand Duke of Tuscany, 1537-1574.
It was established in Florence with a success to
be anticipated under such powerful protection, and it
endured until that patronage was removed by the extinction
of the family in 1737.</p>

<p>It was to be expected that the artists employed were
those of note, yet in the general result, outside of delicate
grotesques, the drawing is more or less the far-away echo
of greater masters whose faults are reproduced, but
whose inspiration is not obtainable. After Michael
Angelo, came a passion for over-delineation of over-developed
muscles; after Raphael&mdash;came the debased
followers of his favourite pupil, Giulio Romano, who
had himself seized all there was of the carnal in Raphael&rsquo;s
genius. But if there is something to be desired in the
composition and line of the cartoons of the Florentine
factory, there is nothing lacking in the consummate skill
of the weavers.</p>

<p>The same Nicholas Karcher who set the standard in
the d&rsquo;Este works, gave of his wonderful skill to the Florentines,
and with him was associated John Rost. These
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg&nbsp;85]</a></span>
were both from Flanders, and although trade regulations
for tapestry workers did not exist in Italy, Duke Cosimo
granted each of these men a sufficient salary, a habitat,
as well as permission to work for outsiders, and in addition
paid them for all work executed for himself.</p>

<p>The subjects for the set of tapestries had entirely left
the old method of pious interpretation and of medi&aelig;val
allegory and revelled in pictured tales of the Scriptures
and of the gods and heroes of mystical Parnassus and of
bellicose Greece, not forgetting those dainty exquisite impossibilities
called grotesques. It was about the time of
the death of Cosimo I (1574), the founder of the
Medicean factory, that a new and unfortunate influence
came into the directorship of the designs. This was
the appointment of Stradano or Johan van der Straaten,
to give his Flemish name, as dominating artist.</p>

<p>He was a man without fine artistic feeling, one of those
whose eye delighted in the exaggerations of decadence
rather than in the restraint of perfect art. He was inspired,
not by past perfection of the Italians among
whom he came to live, but by those of the decline, and
on this he grafted a bit of Northern philistinism. His
brush was unfortunately prolific, and at this time the fine
examples of weaving set by Rost and Karcher had been
replaced by quicker methods so that after 1600 the tapestries
poured out were lamentably inferior. Florentine
tapestry had at this time much pretence, much vulgar
display in its drawing, missing the fine virtues of the
time when Cosimo I dictated its taste, the fine virtues of
&ldquo;grace, gaiety and reflectiveness.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg&nbsp;86]</a></span>
Leo X, the great Medicean pope, was elected in 1513,
he who ordered the great Raphael set of the <i>Acts of the
Apostles</i>, but it was before the establishment of important
looms in Italy, so to Flanders and Van Aelst are due the
glory of first producing this series which afterward was
repeated many times, in the great looms of Europe. Leo
X emulated in the patronage of the arts his father
Lorenzo, well-named Magnificent. What Lorenzo did
in Florence, Leo X endeavoured to do in Rome; make
of his time and of his city the highest expression of culture.
His record, however, is so mixed with the corruption
of the time that its golden glory is half-dimmed.
It was from the licentiousness of cardinals and the
wanton revels of the Vatican in Leo&rsquo;s time that young
Luther the &ldquo;barbarian&rdquo; fled with horror to nail up his
theses on the doors of the churches in Wittenberg.</p>

<p>The history of tapestry in Italy at the Seventeenth
Century was all in the hands of the great families. Italy
was not united under a single royal head, but was a heterogeneous
mass of dukedoms, of foreign invaders, with
the popes as the head of all. But Italy had experienced
a time of papal corruption, which had, as its effect, wars
of disintegration, the retarding of that unity of state
which has only recently been accomplished. State
patronage for the factories was not known, that steady
beneficent influence, changeless through changing reigns.
Popes and great families regulated art in all its manifestations,
and who shall say that envy and rivalry did not
act for its advancement.</p>

<p>The desire to imitate the cultivation and elegance of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg&nbsp;87]</a></span>
Italy was what made returning invaders carry the Renaissance
into the rest of Europe; and in a lesser degree the
process was reversed when, in the Seventeenth Century,
a cardinal of the House of Barberini visited France and,
on viewing in the royal residences a superb display of
tapestries, his envy and ambition were aroused to the extent
of emulation. He could not, with all his power,
possess himself of the hangings that he saw, but he could,
and did, arrange to supply himself generously from another
source. He was the powerful Francesco Barberini,
the son of the pope&rsquo;s brother (Pope Urban VIII,
1623-1644), and it was he who established the Barberini
Library and built from the ruins of Rome&rsquo;s amphitheatres
and baths the great palace which to-day still dominates
the street winding up to its aristocratic elegance.
It was to adorn this palace that Cardinal Francesco established
ateliers and looms and set artists and weavers to
work. This tapestry factory is of especial interest to
America, for some of its chief hangings have come to rest
with us. <i>The Mysteries of the Life and Death of Jesus
Christ</i>, one set is called, and is the property of the Cathedral
of St. John, the Divine, in New York, donated by
Mrs. Clarke.</p>

<p>Cardinal Francesco Barberini chose as his artists those
of the school of Pietro di Cortona with Giovanni Francesco
Romanelli as the head master. The director of the
factory was Giacomo della Riviera allied with M.
Wauters, the Fleming.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> The former was especially concerned
with the pieces now owned by the Cathedral of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg&nbsp;88]</a></span>
St. John, the Divine, in New York, and which are signed
with his name. Romanelli was the artist of the cartoons,
and his fame is almost too well known to dwell upon.
His portrait, in tapestry, hangs in the Louvre, for in
Paris he gained much fame at the Court of Louis XIV,
where he painted portraits of the Grand Monarch, who
never wearied of seeing his own magnificence fixed on
canvas.</p>

<p>It was the hard fate of the Barberini family to lose
power and wealth after the death of their powerful member,
Pope Urban VIII, in 1644. Their wealth and influence
were the shining mark for the arrows of envy,
so it was to be expected that when the next pope, Innocent
X, was elected, they were robbed of riches and
driven out of the country into France. This ended for
a time the work of the tapestry factory, but later the
family returned and work was resumed to the extent of
weaving a superb series picturing scenes especially connected
with the glory of the family, and entitled <i>History
of Urban VIII</i>.</p>

<p>Although Italy is growing daily in power and riches
under her new policy of political unity, there were
dreary years of heavy expense and light income for many
of her famous families, and it was during such an era
that the Barberini family consented to let their tapestries
pass out from the doors of the palace they were woven to
decorate. In 1889, the late Charles M. Ffoulke, Esq.,
became the possessor of all the Barberini hangings, and
added them to his famous collection. Thus through the
enterprise and the fine artistic appreciation of Mr.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg&nbsp;89]</a></span>
Ffoulke, is America able to enjoy the best expression of
Italian tapestry of the Seventeenth Century.</p>

<p>The part that Venice ever played in the history of tapestry
is the splendid one of consumer. In her Oriental
magnificence she exhibited in palace and pageant the
superb products of labour which others had executed.
Without tapestries her big stone palaces would have
lacked the note of soft luxury, without coloured hangings
her balconies would have been but dull settings for languid
ladies, and her water-parades would have missed
the wondrous colour that the Venetian loves. Yet to her
rich market flowed the product of Europe in such exhaustless
stream that she became connoisseur-consumer
only, nor felt the need of serious producing. Workshops
there were, from time to time, but they were as easily
abandoned as they were initiated, and they have left little
either to history or to museums. Venice was, in the Sixteenth
Century, not only a buyer of tapestries for her own
use, but one of the largest markets for the sale of hangings
to all Europe. Men and monarchs from all Christendom
went there to purchase. The same may be said
of Genoa, so that although these two cities had occasional
unimportant looms, their position was that of middleman&mdash;vendors
of the works of others. In addition to
this they were repairers and had ateliers for restoring,
even in those days.</p>

<h2 class="padtop">CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>FRANCE</h3>

<h4>WORKING UP TO GOBELINS FACTORY</h4>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>N following the great sweep of tapestry production
we arrive now in France, there to stay until the
Revolution. The early beginnings were there,
briefly rivalling Arras, but Arras, as we have seen, caught
up the industry with greater zeal and became the ever-famous
leader of the Fifteenth Century, ceding to Brussels
in the Sixteenth Century, whence the high point of
perfection was carried to Paris and caused the establishment
of the Gobelins. The English development under
James I, we defer for a later considering.</p>

<p>Francis I stands, an over-dressed, ever ambitious figure,
at the beginning of things modern in French art. He
still smacks of the Middle Ages in many a custom, many
a habit of thought; his men clank in armour, in his
ch&acirc;teaux lurk the suggestion of the fortress, and his common
people are sunk in a dark and hopeless oppression.
Yet he himself darts about Europe with a springing gait
and an elegant manner, the type of the strong aristocrat
dispensing alike arts of war and arts of the Renaissance.</p>

<p>Was it his visits, bellicose though they were, to Italy
and Spain, that turned his observant eye to the luxury of
woven story and made him desire that France should produce
the same? The Sforza Castle at Milan had walls
enough of tapestry, the pageants of Leonardo da Vinci,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg&nbsp;91]</a></span>
organised at royal command of the lovely Beatrice d&rsquo;Este,
displayed the wealth of woven beauty over which Francis
had time to deliberate in those bad hours after the
battle at Milan&rsquo;s noted neighbour, Pavia.</p>

<p>The attention of Francis was also turned much to
Spain through envy of that extraordinary man of luck
and ability, the Emperor Charles V, and from whom he
made abortive and sullen efforts to wrest Germany, Italy,
anything he could get. In his imprisonment in Madrid,
Francis had time in plenty on which to think of many
things, and why not on the wonderful tapestries of which
Spain has always had a collection to make envious the
rest of Europe. He might forget his two poor little
boys who were left as hostages on his release, but he forgot
not whatever contributes to the pleasure of life.
That peculiarity was one which was yielding luscious
fruit, however, for Francis was the bearer of the torch
of the Renaissance which was to illumine France with
the same fire that flashed and glowed over Italy. This
is a fact to remember in regard to the class of designs of
his own and succeeding periods in France.</p>

<p>How he got his ideas we can reasonably trace, and the
result of them was that he established a royal tapestry
factory in beautiful Fontainebleau, which lies hid in
grateful shade, stretching to flowered fields but a reasonable
distance from the distractions of Paris.</p>

<p>It pleased Francis&mdash;and perhaps the beautiful Diane
de Poitiers and Duchesse d&rsquo;&Eacute;tampes&mdash;to critique plays in
that tiny gem of a theatre at the palace, or to feed the
carp in the pool; but also it gave him pleasure to wander
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg&nbsp;92]</a></span>
into the rooms where the high-warp looms lifted their
utilitarian lengths and artists played at magic with the
wools.</p>

<p>Alas, one cannot dress this patronage of art with too
much of disinterestedness, for these marvellous weavings
were for the adornment of the apartments of the very
persons who caused their productions.</p>

<p>The grand idea of state ateliers had not yet come to
bless the industry. For this reason the factory at Fontainebleau
outlasted the reign of its founder, Francis I,
but a short time.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, examples of its works are still to be seen
and are of great beauty, notably those at the Museum of
the Gobelins in Paris. That a series called the <i>History
of Diana</i> was produced is but natural, considering the
puissance at court of the famous Diane de Poitiers.</p>

<p>When Francis&rsquo; son, Henri II, enfeebled in constitution
by the Spanish confinement, inherited the throne, it was
but natural that he should neglect the indulgences of
his father and prefer those of his own. The Fontainebleau
factory strung its looms and copied its cartoons and
produced, too, certain hangings for Henri&rsquo;s wife, the terrible
Catherine de Medici, on which her vicious eyes
rested in forming her horrid plots; but Henri had ambitions
of his own, small ambitions beside those which
had to do with jealousy of Charles Quint. He let the
factory of Francis I languish, but carried on the art under
his own name and fame.</p>

<p>To give his infant industry a home he looked about
Paris and decided upon the H&ocirc;pital de la Trinit&eacute;, an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg&nbsp;93]</a></span>
institution where asylum was found for the orphans of
the city who seem, in the light of the general brutality
of the time, to have been even in more need of a home
than the parentless child of modern civilisation. A part
of the scheme was to employ in the works such children
as were sufficiently mature and clever to work and to
learn at least the auxiliary details of a craft that is also
an art.</p>

<p>In this way the sixty or so of the orphans of La Trinit&eacute;
were given a means of earning a livelihood. Among
them was one whose name became renowned. This was
Maurice du Bourg, whose tapestries surpassed all others
of his time in this factory&mdash;an important factory, as being
one of the group that later was merged into the
Gobelins.</p>

<p>It must be remembered in identifying French tapestries
of this kind that things Gothic had been vanquished
by the new fashion of things Renaissance, and that all
models were Italian. Giulio Romano and his school of
followers were the mode in France, not only in drawing,
but in the revival of classic subject. This condition in
the art world found expression in a set of tapestries from
the factory of La Trinit&eacute; that are sufficiently celebrated
to be set down in the memory with an underscoring.
This set was composed of fifteen pieces illustrating in
sweeping design and gorgeous colouring the <i>History of
Mausolus and Artemisia</i>. Intense local and personal
interest was given to the set by making an open secret
of the fact that by Artemisia, the Queen of Halicarnassus,
was meant the widowed Queen of France, Catherine
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg&nbsp;94]</a></span>
de Medici, who adored posing as the most famous of
widows and adding ancient glory to her living importance.
To this <i>History</i> French writers accord the important
place of inspirer of a distinctively French Renaissance.</p>

<p>The weaver being Maurice du Bourg, the chief of the
factory of La Trinit&eacute;, the artists were Henri Lerambert
and Antoine Carron, but the set has been many times
copied in various factories, and Artemisia has symbolised
in turn two other widowed queens of France.</p>

<p>Into the throne of France climbed wearily a feeble
youth always under the influence of his mother, Catherine
de Medici; and then it was filled by two other incapable
and final Orleans monarchs, until at last by virtue
of inheritance and sword, it became the seat of that grand
and faulty Henri IV, King of Navarre. By fighting he
got his place, and the habit being strong upon him, he
was in eternal conflict. Some there be who are developed
by sympathy, but Henri IV was developed by opposition,
and thus it was that although opposed in the
matter by his Prime Minister, Sully, he established factories
for the weaving of tapestries in both high and low
warps.</p>

<p>With the desire to see the arts of peace instead of evidences
of war throughout his kingdom just rescued from
conflict, he took all means to set his people in the ways
of pleasing industry. The indefatigable Sully was
plucking the royal sleeve to follow the path of the plough,
to see man&rsquo;s salvation, material and moral, in the ways
of agriculture. But Henri favoured townspeople as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg&nbsp;95]</a></span>
well as country people, and with the Edict of Nantes,
releasing from the bondage of terror a large number of
workers, he showed much industry in encouraging tapestry
factories in and near Paris, and as these all lead to
Gobelins we will consider them.</p>

<p class="incaption">Gobelins Tapestry</p>

<p>Henri IV, notwithstanding his Prime Minister Sully&rsquo;s
opposition to what he considered a favouring of vicious
luxury, began to occupy himself in tapestry factories as
early in his reign as his people could rise from the
wounds of war. Taking his movements chronologically
we will begin with his establishment in 1597 (eight years
after this first Bourbon took the throne) of a high-warp
industry in the house of the Jesuits in the Faubourg St.
Antoine, associating here Du Bourg of La Trinit&eacute; and
Laurent, equally renowned, and the composer of the St.
Merri tapestries.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>Flemish workers in Paris were at this same time, about
1601, encouraged by the king and under protection of
his steward. These Flemings were the nucleus of a great
industry, for it was over them that two famous masters
governed, namely, Fran&ccedil;ois de la Planche and Marc Comans
or Coomans. In 1607 Henri IV established the
looms which these men were called upon to direct.</p>

<p>These two Flemings, great in their art, were men of
family and of some means, for their first venture in the
manufacture of tapestry was a private enterprise like any
of to-day. They looked to themselves to produce the
money for the support of the industry. Combining
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg&nbsp;96]</a></span>
qualities of both the artist and the business man, they
took on apprentices and also established looms in the
provinces (notably Tours and Amiens) where commercialism
was as prominent as in modern methods; that is
to say, that by turning off a lot of cheaper work for
smaller purses, a quick and ready market was found
which supplied the money necessary for the production
of those finer works of art which are left to delight us
to-day.</p>

<p>This manner of procedure of De la Planche and Comans
has an interest far deeper than the mere financial
venture of the men of the early Seventeenth Century, because
it forces upon us the fact that at that time, and
earlier, no state ateliers existed. It was Henri IV who
first saw the wisdom of using the public purse in advancing
this industry. He established Du Bourg in the
Louvre. With Henri Laurent he was placed in the
Tuileries, in 1607, and that atelier lasted until the ministry
of Colbert in the reign of Louis XIV.</p>

<p>In about 1627 the great De la Planche died and his
son, Raphael, established ateliers of his own in the Faubourg
St. Germain, turning out from his looms productions
which were of sufficient excellence to be confused
with those of his father&rsquo;s most profitable factory.
Chronologically this fact belongs later, so we return to
the influence of Henri IV and the master gentleman
tapissiers, De la Planche and Comans.</p>

<p>The very name of the old palace, Les Tournelles, calls
up a crowd of pictures: the death of Henri II at the
tournament in honour of the marriage of his son with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg&nbsp;97]</a></span>
Marie Stuart, the subsequent razing of this ancient home
of kings by Catherine de Medici, and its reconstruction
in its present form by Henri IV. It is here that Richelieu
honoured the brief reign of Louis XIII by a statue,
and it is here that Madame de Sevign&eacute; was born. But
more to our purpose, it was here that, in 1607, Henri IV
cast his kingly eye when establishing a certain tapestry
factory. It was here he placed as directors the celebrated
Comans and De la Planche. It happened in time,
that the looms of Les Tournelles were moved to the
Faubourg St. Marceau and these two men came in
time to direct these and all other looms under royal
patronage.</p>

<p>Examples are not wanting in museums of French work
of this time, showing the development of the art and the
progress that France was making under Henri IV, whose
energy without limit, and whose interests without number,
would to-day have given him the epithet of strenuous.</p>

<p>Under his reign we see the activity that so easily led
France up to the point where all that was needed was
the assembling of the factories under the direction of one
great master. The factories flourishing under Henri IV
were La Trinit&eacute;, the Louvre, the Savonnerie, the Faubourg
St. Marceau and one in the Tuileries. But it
needed the power of Louis XIV to tie all together in the
strength of unity.</p>

<p>The assassin Ravaillac, fanatically muttering through
the streets of Paris, alternately hiding and swaggering
throughout the loveliest month of May, when he thrust
his murderous dagger through the royal coach, not only
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg&nbsp;98]</a></span>
gave a death blow to Henri IV, but to many of these
industries that the king had cherished for his people
against the opposition of his prime minister. The tale of
tapestry is like a vine hanging on a frame of history, and
frequent allusion therefore must be made to the tales of
kings and their ministers.</p>

<p>As it is not always a monarch, but often the power
behind the throne that rules, we see the force of Richelieu
surging behind the reign of the suppressed Louis
XIII, whose rule followed that of the regretted Henri
IV. The master of the then new Palais-Royal had
minor interests of his own, apart from his generous plots
of ruin for the Protestants, for all the French nobility,
and for the House of Austria to which the queen belonged.
Luxurious surroundings were a necessity to this
man, refined in the arts of cruelty and of living. It was
no wonder that under him tapestry weaving was not allowed
to die, but was fostered until that day when the
Grand Monarch would organise and perfect.</p>

<p>In 1643, Louis XIV came to the throne under the guidance
of Anne of Austria, but it was many years before
he was able to make his influence appreciable. Meanwhile,
however, others were fostering the elegant industry.
It was as early as 1647 that two celebrated tapestry
weavers came to Paris from Italy. They were Pierre
Lef&egrave;vre or Lefebvre and his son Jean. The first of these
was the chief of a factory in Florence, whither he presently
returned. Jean Lefebvre stayed in Paris, won his
way all the better for being released from parental rule,
and in time received the great honour of being appointed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg&nbsp;99]</a></span>
one of the directors of the Gobelins, when that factory
was finally organised as an institution of the state.</p>

<p>During the regency of Louis XIV there were also factories
outside of Paris. The high-warp looms of Tours
were of such notable importance that the great Richelieu
placed here an order for tapestries of great splendour
with which to soften his hours of ease. Rheims Cathedral
still harbours the fine hangings which were woven
for the place they now adorn, an unusual circumstance in
the world of tapestry. These hangings (<i>The Story of
Christ</i>) were woven at Rheims, where the factory existed
well known throughout the first half of the Seventeenth
Century. The church had previously ordered tapestries
from another town executed by one Daniel Pepersack,
and so highly approved was his work that he was made
director of the Rheims factory.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>A factory which lasted but a few years, yet has for us
a special interest, is that of Maincy, founded in 1658.
It is here that we hear of the great Colbert and of Lebrun,
whose names are synonymous with prosperity of
the Gobelins. For the factory at Maincy, Lebrun made
cartoons of great beauty, notably that of <i>The Hunt of
Meleager</i>, which now hangs in the Gobelins Museum
in Paris. Louis Blamard was the director of the workmen,
who were Flemish, and who were afterwards called
to Paris to operate the looms of the newly-formed Gobelins,
and the reason of the transference forms a part of
the history of the great people of that day.</p>

<p>Richelieu in dying had passed over his power to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg&nbsp;100]</a></span>
Mazarin, who had used it with every cruelty possible to the
day. He had coveted riches and elegance and had possessed
himself of them; had collected in his palace the
most beautiful works of art of his day or those of a previous
time. After Mazarin came Foucquet, the great, the
iconoclastic, the unfortunate.</p>

<p>It was at Foucquet&rsquo;s estate of Vaux near Maincy that
this tapestry factory of short duration was established and
soon destroyed. The powerful Superintendent of Finance,
with his eye for the beautiful and desire for the
luxury of kings, built for himself such a ch&acirc;teau as only
the magnificence of that time produced. It was situated
far enough from Paris to escape any sort of ennui, and
was surrounded by gardens most marvellous, within a
beauteous park. It lay, when finished, like a jewel on
the fair bosom of France. The great superintendent
conceived the idea of pleasing the young king, Louis XIV,
by inviting the court for a wondrous f&ecirc;te in its lovely
enclosure.</p>

<p>Foucquet was a man of the world, and of the court,
knew how to please man&rsquo;s lighter side, and how to use
social position for his own ends. France calls him a
&ldquo;dilapidateur,&rdquo; but when his power and incidentally the
revenues of state, were laid out to produce a day of pleasure
for king and court, his taste and ability showed such
a f&ecirc;te as could scarce be surpassed even in those days of
artistic f&ecirc;tes champ&ecirc;tres.</p>

<p>The great gardens were brought into use in all the
beauty of flower and vine, of lawn and bosquet, of terrace
and fountain. When the guests arrived, weary of town
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg&nbsp;101]</a></span>
life, they were turned loose in the enchanting place like
birds uncaged, and to the beauty of Nature was added
that of folk as gaily dressed as the flowers. The king
was invited to inspect it all for his pleasure, asked to
feast in the gardens, and to repose in the splendid ch&acirc;teau.</p>

<p>He was young then, in the early twenties, and luxury
was younger then than now, so he was pleased to spend
the time in almost childish enjoyments. A play <i>al fresco</i>
was almost a necessity to a royal garden party, which was
no affair of an hour like ours in the busy to-day, but extended
the livelong day and evening. Moli&egrave;re was ready
with his sparkling satires at the king&rsquo;s caprice, and into
the garden danced the players before an audience to whom
vaudeville and <i>caf&eacute; chantant</i> were exclusively a royal
novelty arranged for their delectation.</p>

<p>It is easy to see the elegant young king and his court
in the setting of a sophisticated out-of-doors, wandering
on grassy paths, lingering under arches of roses, plucking
a flower to nest beside a smiling face, stopping where
servants&mdash;obsequious adepts, they were then&mdash;supplied
dainty things to eat and drink. Madame de Sevign&eacute; was
there, she of the observant eye, an eye much occupied at
this time with the figure of Superintendent Foucquet, the
host of this glorious occasion. This gracious lady lacked
none of the appearance of frivolity, coiffed in curls,
draped in lace and soft silks, but her mind was deeply
occupied with the signs of the times. All the elegance
of the ch&acirc;teau, all the seductive beauty of terrace, garden,
and bosquet, all the piquant surprises of play and pyrotechnics,
what were they? Simply the disinterested
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg&nbsp;102]</a></span>
effort of a subject to give pleasure to His Majesty, the
King.</p>

<p>There were those present who had long envied
Foucquet, with his ever-increasing power and wealth, his
ability to patronise the arts, to collect, and even to establish
his tapestry looms like a king, for his own palace and
for gifts. This grand f&ecirc;te in the lovely month of June
did more than shower pleasure, more than gratify the lust
of the eye. In effect, it was a gathering of exquisite
beauties and charming men, lost in light-hearted play; in
reality, it proved to be an incitive to envy and malice, and
a means to ruin.</p>

<p>Among the observant guests at this wondrous f&ecirc;te
champ&ecirc;tre was Colbert, young, ambitious, keen. He
was not slow to see the holes in Foucquet&rsquo;s fabric, nor
were others. And so, whispers came to the king.
Foucquet&rsquo;s downfall is the old story of envy, man trying
to climb by ruining his superiors, hating those whose
magnificence approaches their own. Foucquet&rsquo;s unequalled
entertainment of the king was made to count as
naught. Louis, even before leaving for Paris, had begun
to ask whence came the money that purchased this
wide fertile estate stretching to the vision&rsquo;s limit, the
money that built the ch&acirc;teau of regal splendour,
the money that paid for the prodigal pleasures of that
day of delights? Foucquet thought to have gained the
confidence and admiration of the king. But, on leaving,
Louis said coldly, &ldquo;We shall scarce dare ask you to our
poor palace, seeing the superior luxury to which you are
accustomed.&rdquo; A fearful cut, but only a straw to the fate
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg&nbsp;103]</a></span>
which followed, the investigations into the affairs of
Superintendent Foucquet. His arrest and his conviction
followed and then the eighteen dreary years of imprisonment
terminating only with the superintendent&rsquo;s life.
Madame de Sevign&eacute; saw him in the beginning, wept for
her hero, but after a while she, too, fell away from his
weary years.</p>

<p>With his arrest came the end of the glories of the
Ch&acirc;teau of Vaux near Maincy, and so, too, came an end
to the factory where so fine results had been obtained in
tapestry weaving. Yet the effort was not in vain, for
some of the tapestries remain and the factory was the
school where certain celebrated men were trained.</p>

<p>It may easily have been that Louis XIV discovered on
that day at Vaux the excellence of Lebrun whom he
made director at the Gobelins in Paris when they were
but newly formed. Foucquet, wasting in prison, had
many hours in which to think on this and on the advancement
of the very man who had been keenest in running
him to cover, the great Colbert. It was well for France,
it was well for the artistic industry whose history occupies
our attention, that these things happened; but we,
nevertheless, feel a weakness towards the man of genius
and energy caged and fretted by prison bars, for he had
shown initiative and daring, qualities of which the world
has ever need.</p>

<p>Foucquet&rsquo;s factory lasted three years. It was directed
by Louis Blamard or Blammaert of Oudenarde, and employed
a weaver named Jean Z&egrave;gre, who came from the
works at Enghien, works sufficiently known to be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg&nbsp;104]</a></span>
remarked. Lebrun composed here and fell under the
influence of Rubens, an influence that pervaded the
grandiose art of the day. The earliest works of Lebrun,
three pieces, were later used to complete a set of Rubens&rsquo;
<i>History of Constantine</i>. <i>The Muses</i> was a set by Lebrun,
also composed for the Ch&acirc;teau of Vaux. The
charm of this set is a matter for admiration even now
when, alas, all is destroyed but a few fragments.</p>

<p>The disgrace of Foucquet was the last determining
cause of the establishment of the Gobelins factory under
Louis XIV, an act which after this brief review of Paris
factories (and an allusion to sporadic cases outside of
Paris) we are in position at last to consider. Pursuit of
knowledge in regard to the Gobelins factory leads us
through ways the most flowery and ways the most stormy,
through sunshine and through the dark, right up to our
own times.</p>

<h2 class="padtop">CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>THE GOBELINS FACTORY, 1662</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">C</span>OLBERT saw the wisdom of taking direction
for the king, Louis XIV, of the looms of Foucquet&rsquo;s
ch&acirc;teau. Travel being difficult enough
to make desirable the concentration of points of interest,
Colbert transferred the looms of Vaux to Paris. To do
this he had first to find a habitat, and what so suitable
as the Hotel des Gobelins, a collection of buildings on
the edge of Paris by which ran a little brook called
the Bi&egrave;vre. The Sieur Leleu was then the owner, and
the sale of the buildings was made on June 6, 1662.</p>

<p>This was the beginning only of the purchase, for Louis
XIV added adjoining houses for the various uses of the
large industries he had in mind, for the development of
arts and crafts of all sorts, and for the lodging of the
workers.</p>

<p>The story of the original occupants of the premises is
almost too well known to recount. The simple tale of
the conscientious &ldquo;dyers in scarlet&rdquo; is told on the marble
plaque at the present entry into the collection of buildings
still standing, still open to visitors. It is a tale with
a moral, an obvious simple moral with no need of Alice&rsquo;s
Duchess to point it out, and it smacks strong of the honesty
of a labour to which we owe so much.</p>

<p>Late in the Fifteenth Century the brothers Gobelin
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg&nbsp;106]</a></span>
came to the city of Paris to follow their trade, which
was dyeing, and their ambition, which was to produce
a scarlet dye like that they had seen flaunting in the glowing
city of Venice. The trick of the trade in those days
was to find a water of such quality that dyes took to it
kindly. The tiny river, or rather brook, called the
Bi&egrave;vre, which ran softly down towards the Seine had the
required qualities, and by its murmuring descent, Jean
and Philibert pitched the tents of their fortune.</p>

<p>They succeeded, too, so well that we hear of their descendants
in later centuries as having become gentlemen,
not of property only, but of cultivation, and far removed
from trades or bartering. Their name is ever famous,
for it tells not only the story of the two original dyers,
but of their subsequent efforts in weaving, and finally it
has come to mean the finest modern product of the hand
loom. Just as Arras gave the name to tapestry in the
Fourteenth Century, so the Gobelins has given it to the
time of Louis XIV, even down to our own day&mdash;more
especially in Europe, where the word tapestry is far less
used than here.</p>

<p>The tablet now at the Gobelins&mdash;let us re-read it, for
in some hasty visit to the Latin Quarter we may have overlooked
it. Translated freely it reads, &ldquo;Jean and Philibert
Gobelin, merchant dyers in scarlet, who have left their
name to this quarter of Paris and to the manufacture of
tapestries, had here their atelier, on the banks of the
Bi&egrave;vre, at the end of the Fifteenth Century.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another inscription takes a great leap in time, skips
over the centuries when France was not in the lead in this
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg&nbsp;107]</a></span>
art, and recommences with the awakening strength under
the wise care of Henri IV. It reads:</p>

<p>&ldquo;April 1601. Marc Comans and Fran&ccedil;ois de la
Planche, Flemish tapestry weavers, installed their ateliers
on the banks of the Bi&egrave;vre.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;September 1667, Colbert established in the buildings
of the Gobelins the manufacture of the furniture
(<i>meubles</i>) of the Crown, under the direction of Charles
Lebrun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The tablet omits the date that is fixed in our mind as
that of the beginning of the modern tapestry industry in
France, the year 1662, but that is only because it deals
with a date of more general importance, the time when
the Gobelins was made a manufactory of all sorts of
gracious products for the luxury of palaces and ch&acirc;teaux,
not tapestries alone, but superb furniture, and metal work,
inlay, mounting of porcelains and all that goes to furnish
the home of fortunate men.</p>

<p>In that year of 1667 was instituted the ateliers supported
by the state, not dependent upon the commercialism
of the workers. This made possible the development
of such men as Boulle with his superb furniture, of Riesner
with his marquetry, of Caffieri with his marvels in
metal to decorate all <i>meubles</i>, even vases, which were then
coming from China in their beauty of solid glaze or
eccentric ornament.</p>

<p>Here lies the great secret of the success of Louis XIV
in these matters, with the coffers of the Crown he rewarded
the artists above the necessity of mere living, and
freed each one for the best expression of his own especial
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg&nbsp;108]</a></span>
art. The day of individual financial venture was gone.
The tapestry masters of other times had both to work
and to worry. They had to be artists and at the same time
commercial men, a chimerical combination.</p>

<p>The expense of maintaining a tapestry factory was an
incalculable burden. A man could not set up a loom,
a single one, as an artist sets up an easel, and in solitude
produce his woven work of art. Other matters go to the
making of a tapestry than weaving, matters which have
to do with cartoons for the design, dyes, wools, threads,
etc.; so that many hands must be employed, and these
must all be paid. The apprentice system helped much,
but even so, the master of the atelier was responsible for
his finances and must look for a market for his goods.</p>

<p>What a relief it was when the king took all this responsibility
from the shoulders and said to the artists and
artisans, &ldquo;Art for Art&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; or whatever was the equivalent
shibboleth of that day. Here was comfort assured
for the worker, with a housing in the Gobelins, or in that
big asylum, the Louvre, where an apartment was the
reward of virtue. And now was a market assured for a
man&rsquo;s work, a royal market, with the king as its chief,
and his favourites following close.</p>

<p>The ateliers scattered about Paris were allied in spirit,
were all the result of the encouragement of preceding
monarchs, but it remained for Le Grand Monarque to
gather all together and form a state solidarity.</p>

<p>Kings must have credit, even though others do the
work. It was the labour of the able Colbert to organise
this factory. He was in favour then. It was after his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg&nbsp;109]</a></span>
acuteness had helped in deposing the splendid brigand
Foucquet, and his power was serving France well, so well
that he brought about his head the inevitable jealousy
which finally threw him, too, into unmerited disgrace.</p>

<p>Colbert, then, although a Minister of State, head of
the Army of France, and a few other things, had the fate
of the Gobelins in his hand. As the ablest is he who
chooses best his aids, Colbert looked among his countrymen
for the proper director of the newly-organised institution.
He selected Charles Lebrun.</p>

<p>The very name seems enough, in itself. It is the concrete
expression of ability, not only as an artist, but as
a leader of artists, a director, an assembler, a blender.
He called to the Gobelins, as addition to those already
there, the apprentices from La Trinit&eacute;, the weavers from
the Faubourg St. Germain, and from the Louvre. He
established three ateliers of high-warp under Jean Jans,
Jean Lefebvre and Henri Laurent; also two ateliers of
low-warp under Jean Delacroix and Jean-Baptiste
Mozin. When charged with the decoration of Versailles
he had under his direction fifty artists of differing
scopes, which alone would show his power of assembling
and leading, of blending and ordering. Workers at the
Gobelins numbered as many as two hundred fifty, and
apprentices were legion.</p>

<p>Ten or twelve important artists composed the designs
for tapestries, yet the mind of Lebrun is seen to dominate
all; his genius was their inspiration. It was he whose
influence pervaded the decorative art of the day. More
than any others in that grand age he influenced the tone
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg&nbsp;110]</a></span>
of the artistic work. We may say it was the king, we
may have styles named for the king, but it was Lebrun
who made them what they were. The spirit of the time
was there, monarch and man made that, but it was Lebrun
who had the talent to express it in art. It was a
time when France was fully awake, more fully awake
than Italy who had, in fact, commenced the somnolence
of her art; she was strong with that brutal force that is
recently up from savagery, and she took her grandeur
seriously.</p>

<p>At least that was the attitude of the king. No lightness,
no effervescing cynical humour ever disturbed the
heavy splendour of his pose. And this grand pose of
the king, Lebrun expressed in the heavy sumptuousness
of decoration. The tapestries of that time show the mood
of the day in subject, in border and in colour. All is
superb, grandiose.</p>

<p>Rubens, although not of France, dominated Europe
with his magnificence of style, a style suited to the time,
expressing force rather than refinement, yet with a splendid
decorative value in the art we are considering.
Flanders looked to him for inspiration, and his lead was
everywhere followed. His virile work had power to
inspire, to transmit enthusiasm to others, and thus he was
responsible for much of the improvement in decorative
art, the re-establishment of that art upon an intellectual
basis. Designs from his hands were full, splendid and
self-assertive; harmony and proportion were there. A
study of the <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i> series and of the plates
given in this volume will establish and verify this.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg&nbsp;111]</a></span>
Lebrun&rsquo;s century was the same as that of Rubens, but
the former had the fine feeling for art of the Latin, who
knows that its first province is to please. A comparison
between the two men must not be carried too far, for
Rubens was essentially a painter, attacking the field of
decoration only with the overflow of imagination, while
Lebrun&rsquo;s life and talent were wholly directed in the way
of beautifying palaces and ch&acirc;teaux. Yet Rubens&rsquo; work
gave a fresh impulse to tapestry weaving in Brussels
while Lebrun was inspiring it in France.</p>

<p>Lebrun had, then, to direct the talent and the labour
of an army of artists and artisans, and to keep them working
in harmony. It was no mean task, for one artist alone
was not left to compose an entire picture, but each was
taken for his specialty. One artist drew the figures, another
the animals, another the trees, and another the architecture;
but it was the director, Lebrun, who composed
and harmonised the whole. Thus, although the number
of tapestries actually composed by him is few, it was his
great mind that ordered the work of others. He was the
leader of the orchestra, the others were the instruments
he controlled.</p>

<p>It was while at Vaux that Lebrun had more time for
his own composition. He there produced a series called
<i>Les Renomm&eacute;s</i>, masterpieces of pure decorative composition.
These were designed as porti&egrave;res for the Ch&acirc;teau
of Maincy. They came to be models for the Gobelins,
and were woven to hang at royal doors, the doors of
Foucquet being at this time dressed with iron bars.</p>

<p>The Gobelins wove seventy-two sets after this beautiful
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg&nbsp;112]</a></span>
model which had made Lebrun&rsquo;s d&eacute;but as an artist.
Foucquet had given him a more pretentious work; it was
to complete a suite, the <i>History of Constantine</i>, after
Raphael. Rubens had given a fresh flush of popularity
to this subject, which again became the mode. The <i>History
of Meleager</i> was begun at Vaux and finished at the
Gobelins. Later, Vaux forgotten, or at least a thing of
the past, Lebrun&rsquo;s decorative genius found expression in
the series called <i>The Months</i> or <i>The Royal Residences</i>,
of which there were twelve hangings.</p>

<p>In these last the scheme is the perfection of decoration,
with the subject well subdued, yet so subtly placed that
notwithstanding its modesty, the eye promptly seeks it.
The castle in the distance, the motive holding aloft the
sign of the Zodiac, are seen even before the splendid columns
and the foliage of the middle-ground.</p>

<p>Such a hanging has power to play pretty tricks with
the imagination of him who gazes upon it. The columns,
smooth and solid, declare him at once to be in a
place of luxury. Beyond the foreground&rsquo;s columns, but
near enough for touching, are trees to make a pleasant
shade, and beyond, in the far distance, is the ch&acirc;teau set
in fair gardens, even the ch&acirc;teau where the lovely Louise
de la Valli&egrave;re held her court until conscience drove her
to the convent.</p>

<p>The set of most renown, woven under Lebrun&rsquo;s generalship,
was that splendid advertisement of the king&rsquo;s
magnificence known as the <i>History of the King</i>. Louis
demanded above all else that he should appear splendidly
before men. He was jealous of the magnificence of all
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg&nbsp;113]</a></span>
kings and emperors, whether living or dead. Even Solomon&rsquo;s
glory was not to typify greater than his. With
this end in view, pomp was his pleasure, ceremony was
his gratification. Add to these an insatiable vanity that
knows not the disintegrating assaults of a sense of humour,
and we have a man to be fed on profound adulation.</p>

<p>The subjects for the <i>History of the King</i> were chosen
from official solemnities during the first twelve years of
his reign. Lebrun&rsquo;s task, into which he threw his whole
soul, was to celebrate the power and the glory of his
master, to show the king in perpetual picture as the greatest
living personage, and to still his fears with regard to
long defunct royal rivals. His life as a man was pictured,
his marriage, his treaties with other nations, and
his actions as a soldier in the various battles or military
conquests. In the latter affairs he had not even been
present, but poet&rsquo;s license was given where the glorification
of the king was concerned. The flattery that surrounds
a king thus gave him reason to think that his
persecutions in the Palatinate and his constant warfare
were greatly to his glory.</p>

<p>It is the tapestry in this set that is called <i>Visit of
Louis XIV to the Gobelins</i> that interests us strongly,
as being delightfully pertinent to our subject. The picture
shows the king in chary indulgence standing just
within the court of the Royal Factory, while eager masters
of arts and crafts strenuously heap before him their
masterpieces. (Plate facing page <a href="#LOUIS_XIV_VISITING"><b>114</b></a>.)</p>

<p>The borders of these sumptuous hangings are to be
enjoyed when the original set can be seen, for the borders
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg&nbsp;114]</a></span>
are Lebrun&rsquo;s special care. The three pieces added late
in the reign are drawn with different borders, and no
stronger example of deteriorating change can be given,
the change in the composition of the border which took
place after the passing of Lebrun. The pieces in the
set of the <i>Life of the King</i> numbered forty; with the addition
of the later ones, forty-three. They were repeated
many times in the succeeding years, but on low-warp,
reduced in size, and without the superb decorative border
which was composed by Lebrun&rsquo;s own hand for the
original series.</p>

<p>Fran&ccedil;ois de la Meulen was Lebrun&rsquo;s able coadjutor
in the direction of this famous set. Eight artists accustomed
to the work were charged with the cartoons, but
Lebrun headed it all. It is interesting to note that the
temptation to sport in the fields of pure decoration, led
him into the personal composition of the border. These
borders are the very acme of perfection in decoration,
full of strength, of grace, and of purity. They suggest
the classic, yet are full of the warm blood of the hour;
they are Greek, yet they are French, and they foreshadow
the centuries of beautiful design which France supplies
to the world.</p>

<p>The colouring of these tapestries seems to us strong,
but it is not a strength of tone that offends, rather it adds
force to the subject. The charge is made that in this
suite the deplorable change had taken place which lifted
tapestries from their original intent and made of them
paintings in wool. That change certainly did come later,
as we shall see and deplore, but at present the colours
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg&nbsp;115]</a></span>
kept comparatively low in number. The proof of this
was that only seventy-nine tones were discoverable when
the Gobelins factory in recent years examined this hanging
for the purposes of reproducing it.</p>

<p class="incaption">Gobelins Tapestry, Epoch Louis XIV</p>

<p>Lebrun&rsquo;s task in this series seems to us far more simple
in point of picturesqueness than it did to him, for the
affairs of the time were those depicted. They were the
events of the moment, and the personages taking part in
them were given in recognisable portraiture. Figure a
tapestry of to-day depicting the laying of a cornerstone
by our National President, every one in modern dress,
every face a portrait, and Lebrun&rsquo;s task appears in a
new light. Yet he was able to accomplish it in a way
which gratified the overfed vanity of Louis and which
more than gratifies the art lover of to-day.</p>

<p>The set called the <i>History of Alexander</i> is one of Lebrun&rsquo;s
famous works. In subject it departs from the
affairs of the time of the Sun King, to portray the Greek
Conqueror, to whom Louis liked to be compared. For
us the classic dress is less piquant than the gorgeous
toilettes of France in the Seventeenth Century, and the
battle of the Granicus is less engaging than scenes from
the life of Louis XIV. But this is a famous set, and
paintings of the same may be found in the Louvre.</p>

<p>Originally the tapestries were but five, but the larger
ones having been divided into three each, the number is
increased. The Gobelins factory wove several sets, and,
the model becoming popular, it was copied many times
in Brussels and elsewhere, often with distressing alterations
in drawing, in border, and in colour.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg&nbsp;116]</a></span>
There were other suites produced at the Gobelins at
this wonderful time of co-operation between Colbert, the
minister, and Lebrun, the artist. Colbert, in his wisdom
of state economy, had repaired the ravages of the previous
ministry, and had the coffers full for the government&rsquo;s
necessities and the king&rsquo;s indulgences. Well for the liberal
arts, that he counted these among the matters to be
fostered in this wonderful time, which rises like a mountain
ridge between feudal savagery and modern civilisation.</p>

<p>But Colbert, powerful as was his position, had yet to
suffer by reason of the despotism of the absolute monarch
who ruled every one within borders of bleeding France.
Louis began, before youth had left him, the terrible persecution
of the people in the name of religion, and established
also an indulgent left-hand court. The prodigious
expenditures for these were bound to be liquidated by
Colbert. Faithful to his master, he produced the money.</p>

<p>The charm of royalty surrounded Louis, he was idealised
by a people proud of his position as the most magnificent
monarch of Europe; but Colbert was denounced
as a tax collector and a persecutor, yet suffered in silence,
if he might protect his king. Before he died, Louvois
had undermined his credit even with the king, and his
funeral at night, to avoid a mob, was a pathetic fact.
France has now reinstated him, say modern men&mdash;but
that is the irony of fate.</p>

<h2 class="padtop">CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>THE GOBELINS FACTORY (<i>Continued</i>)</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">C</span>OLBERT died most inopportunely in 1684 and
was succeeded by his enemy, and for that matter,
the enemy of France, the man of jealousy and
cruelty, Louvois. He had long hated Colbert for his
success, counting as an affront to himself Colbert&rsquo;s marvellous
establishment of a navy which he felt rivalled in
importance the army, over which the direction was his
own.</p>

<p>On finding Colbert&rsquo;s baton in his hand, it was but
human to strike with it as much as to direct, and one
of his blows fell upon the head of the Gobelins, Lebrun.
Thus history is woven into tapestry. Lebrun was not
at once deposed; first his magnificent wings were clipped,
so that his flights into artistic originality were curtailed.
This petty persecution had a benumbing effect. New
models were not encouraged. Strangely enough, the
scenes that glorified the king were no longer reproduced,
nor those of antique kings like Alexander, whose greatness
Louis was supposed to rival.</p>

<p>It is not possible to tell the story of tapestry without
telling the story of the times, for the lesser acts are but
the result of the greater. There are matters in the life
of Louis XIV that are inseparable from our account.
These are the associating of his life with that of the three
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg&nbsp;118]</a></span>
women whom he exalted far higher than his queen, Marie
Th&eacute;r&egrave;se, the well-known, much-vaunted mesdames, de la
Valli&egrave;re, de Montespan and de Maintenon.</p>

<p>Even before the death of Colbert, Louvois, with his
army, had encouraged the religious persecutions and wars
of the king, and shortly after, the widow of the poet
Scarron became the royal spouse. Relentless, indeed,
were the persecutions then. It was in the same year of
the marriage that Louis revoked the Edict of Nantes,
through the hand of the weak Le Tellier, an action which
gave Louvois ample excuse for depleting the state coffers.
Making military expense an excuse, he turned his blighting
hand toward the Gobelins and restricted the director,
Lebrun, even to denying him the golden threads so necessary
for the production of the sumptuous tapestries.</p>

<p>And so for a time the productions of the looms lacked
their accustomed elegance. Under Madame de Maintenon,
the spirit of a morose religion pervaded the court.
All France was suffering under it, and in its name unbelievable
horrors were perpetrated in every province.
Paris was not too well informed of these to interfere with
bourgeois life, but at court the hypocritical soul of
Madame de Maintenon made self-righteousness a virtue.</p>

<p>An almost laughable result of this pious rectitude was
a certain order given at the Gobelins. Madame de Maintenon
had thrust her leading nose between the doors of the
factory and had scented outraged modesty in the reproduction
there of the tapestries woven from models of
Raphael, Giulio Romano and the classicists, cartoons in
great favour after the hampering of Lebrun&rsquo;s imagination.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg&nbsp;119]</a></span>
The naked gods from Olympus must be clothed,
said this pious and modest lady.</p>

<p>This was very well for her r&ocirc;le, as her influence over
the king lay deep-rooted in her pose of heavy virtue;
but at the Gobelins, the tapestry-makers must have
laughed long and loud at the prudery which they were
set to further by actually weaving pictured garments and
setting them into the hangings where the lithe limbs of
Apollo, and Venus&rsquo; lovely curves, had been cut away.
The hanging called <i>The Judgment of Paris</i> is one of those
altered to suit the refinement of the times.</p>

<p>Louvois&rsquo; dominance lasted as long as Lebrun, so the
genius of the latter never reasserted itself in the factory.
Two methods of supply for designs came in vogue, and
mark the time. One was to turn to the old masters of
Italy&rsquo;s high Renaissance for drawings. This brought
a quantity of drawings of fables and myths into use, so
that palace walls were decorated with Greek gods instead
of modern ones. Raphael, as a master in decoration, was
carefully copied, also other men of his school. The second
source of cartoons was chosen by Louvois, who
searched among previous works for the most celebrated
tapestries and had them copied without change.</p>

<p>Thus came the Gobelins to reproduce hangings that
had not originated in their ateliers. All this traces the
change that came from the clipping of Lebrun&rsquo;s wings
of genius. Identification marks they are, when old
tapestries come our way.</p>

<p>Pierre Mignard succeeded Lebrun as director of the
Gobelins after the death of the greatest genius of decoration
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg&nbsp;120]</a></span>
in modern times. Lebrun had seen such prosperity
of tapestry weaving that eight hundred workers had
scarcely been enough to supply the tapestries ordered.
When Mignard came for his five years of direction, things
had mightily changed, and he did nothing to revive or
encourage the work. He owed his appointment entirely
to Louvois, whose prot&eacute;g&eacute; he had long been. The same
year, 1691, saw the death of them both.</p>

<p>Until 1688 the factory was at its best time of productiveness,
reaching the perfection of modern drawing in
its cartoons, and, in its weaving, equalling the manner of
Brussels in the early Sixteenth Century.</p>

<p>From then on began the decline, for the reasons so
forcibly written on pages of history. The French king&rsquo;s
ambition to conquer, his animosity&mdash;jealousy, if you
will&mdash;toward Holland, his unceasing conflict with England,
added to his fierce attacks on religionists, especially
in the Palatinate&mdash;all these things required the most stupendous
expenditures. The Mississippi was now discovered,
the English colonists were in conflict with the
French, here in America, and the New World was becoming
too desirable a possession for Louis to be willing
to cede his share without a struggle; and thus came the
expense of fighting the English in that far land which
was at least thirty days&rsquo; sail away.</p>

<p>Perhaps Mignard worked against odds too great for
even a strong director. Such drains on the state treasury
as were made by the self-indulgent court, and by the
political necessities, demanded not only depriving the
Gobelins of proper expensive materials, but in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg&nbsp;121]</a></span>
department of furniture and ornaments, demanded also the
establishment of a sinister melting pot, a hungry mouth
that devoured the precious metals already made more
precious by the artistic hands of the gold-working artists.</p>

<p>Mignard&rsquo;s futile work was finished by his demise in
1695. Such was then the pitiable conditions at the
Gobelins that it was not considered worth while to fill
his place. Thus ended the first period of that beautiful
conception, art sustained by the state, artists relieved
from all care except that of expressing beauty.</p>

<p>The ateliers were closed; the weavers had to seek other
means of gaining their living. The busy Gobelins, a
very Paradise of workers, an establishment which felt
itself the pride of Paris and the pet of the king, full of
merry apprentices and able masters, this happy solidarity
fell under neglect. The courtyards were lonely; the
Bi&egrave;vre rippled by unused; the buildings were silent and
deserted. Some of the workers were happy enough to
be taken in at Beauvais, some returned to Flanders, but
many were at the miserable necessity of dropping their
loved professions and of joining the royal troops, for
which the relentless ambition of the king had such large
and terrible use.</p>

<p>The time when the factory remained inactive were the
dolorous years from 1694 to 1697. It was in the latter
year that peace was signed in the Holland town of Ryswick,
which ended at least one of Louis&rsquo; bloody oppressions,
the fierce attacks in the Palatinate.</p>

<p>The place of Colbert was never filled, so far as the
Gobelins was concerned. Louvois had not its interests
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg&nbsp;122]</a></span>
in his hard hands, nor had his immediate followers in
state administrations up to 1708, which included Mansard
(of the roofs) and the flippity courtesan, the Duc d&rsquo;Antin.
But power was later given to Jules Robert de Cotte
to raise the fallen Gobelins by his own wise direction,
assisted by his father&rsquo;s political co-operation (1699-1735).
Once again can we smile in thinking of the factory
where the wares of beauty were produced. Of
course, the artists flocked to the centre, eager to express
themselves. The one most interesting to us was Claude
Audran. Others there were who contributed adorable
designs and helped build up the most exquisite expressions
of modern art, but, alas, their modesty was such that
their names are scarce known in connexion with the art
they vivified.</p>

<p>The aged Louis was ending his forceful reign in increasing
weakness, deserted at the finish by all but the
rigid de Maintenon; and four-year-old Louis, the grandson
of the Grand Dauphin, was succeeding under the
direction of the Regent of Orleans. New monarchs, new
styles, the rule was; for the newly-crowned must have his
waves of flattery curling about the foot of the throne.
Louis XIV, the Grand Monarque, lived to his pose of
heavy magnificence even in the furnishing and decorating
of the apartments where he ruled as king and where he
lived as man. Sumptuous splendour, expressed in heavy
design, in deep colouring, with much red and gold, these
were the order of the day, and best expressed the reign.</p>

<p>But with Philip as regent, and the young king but a
baby, a gayer mood must creep into the articles of beauty
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg&nbsp;123]</a></span>
with which man self-indulgently decorates his surroundings.
Pomp of a heavy sort had no place in the regent&rsquo;s
heart. He saw life lightly, and liked to foster the belief
that a man might make of it a pretty play.</p>

<p>Thus, given so good excuse for a new school of decoration,
Claude Audran snatched up his talented brush
and put down his dainty inspirations with unfaltering
delicacy of touch. He wrote upon his canvas poems in
life, symphonies in colour, created a whole world of tasteful
fancy, a world whose entire intent was to please. He
left the heavy ways of pomp and revelled in a world
where roses bloom and ribbons flutter, where clouds are
strong to support the svelte deity upon them, and where
the rudest architecture is but an airy trellis.</p>

<p>The classic, the Greek, he never forgot. It was ever
his inspiration, his alphabet with which he wrote the
spirit of his composition, but it was a classic thought
played upon with the most talented of variations. Pure
Greek was too cold and chaste for the temper of the time
in which he lived and worked and of which he was the
creature; and so his classic foundation was graced with
curves, with colour, with artful abandon, and all the
charming fripperies of one of the most exquisite periods
of decoration. Gods and goddesses were a necessary part
of such compositions, and a continual playing among
amorini, but such deities lived not upon Olympus, nor
anywhere outside France of the Eighteenth Century.
The heavy human forms made popular by the inflation
of the Seventeenth Century were banished to some dark
haven reserved for by-gone modes, and these new gods
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg&nbsp;124]</a></span>
were exquisite as fairies while voluptuous as courtesans.
They were all caught young and set, while still adolescent
and slender, in suitable niches of delicate surroundings.</p>

<p>The talent of Audran, not content with figures alone,
was lavishly expended on those ingenious decorative designs
which formed the frame and setting of the figures,
the airy world in which they lived and in the borders that
confined the whole.</p>

<p>Only a study of tapestries or their photographs can
show the radical depth of the change from the styles prevailing
under the influence of Madame de Maintenon to
those produced by Audran and his school under the
regence. The difference in character of the two dominations
is the very evident cause. It is as though the
severe moral pose of de Maintenon had suppressed a
whole Pandora&rsquo;s box of loves and graces who, when the
lid was lifted by the Regent, flew, a happy crew, to fix
themselves in dainty decorative effect, trailing with them
their complement of accessory flowers, butterflies, clouds
and tempered grotesques.</p>

<p>Philippe d&rsquo;Orleans, under the influence of the corrupt
cleverness of Cardinal du Bois, celebrated the few years
of his regency by bankrupting France with John Law&rsquo;s
financial fallacies (this was the time of the South Sea
Bubble and the Mississippi scheme) and by returning to
Spain her princess as unsuited for the boy king&rsquo;s mate&mdash;with
war as the natural result of that insult.</p>

<p>But he also let artists have their way, and the style that
they supplied him, shows a talented invention unsurpassed.
Audran we will place at the top, but only to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg&nbsp;125]</a></span>
fix a name, for there was a whole army of men composing
the tapestry designs that so delighted the people of those
days and that have gone on thrilling their beholders for
two hundred years, and which distinguish French designs
from all others&mdash;which give them that indefinable quality
of grace and softness that we denominate French. Wizards
in design were the artists who developed it and those
who continue it in our own times.</p>

<h3>THE GOBELINS FACTORY (<i>Continued</i>)</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>UDRAN had in his studio Andr&eacute; Watteau, whose
very name spells sophisticated pastorals of exceeding
loveliness. Watteau worked with Audran
when he was producing his most inspired set of tapestry,
on which we must dwell for a bit for pure pleasure.
This set is called the <i>Porti&egrave;res des Dieux</i>.</p>

<p>That they were porti&egrave;res, only door-hangings, is a fact
too important to be slipped by. It denotes one of the
greatest changes in tapestries when the size of a hanging
comes down from twenty or thirty feet to the dimensions
of a doorway. It speaks a great change in interiors, and
sets tapestries on a new plane. Later on, they are still
further diminished. But the sadness of noting this
change is routed by the thrills of pleasure given by the
exquisite design, colour and weave.</p>

<p>The <i>Porti&egrave;res of the Gods</i> was, then, a series of eight
small hangings, four typifying the seasons and four the
elements, with an appropriate Olympian forming the
central point of interest and the excuse for an entourage
of thrilling and graceful versatility. This set has been
copied so many times that even the most expert must fail
in trying to identify the date of reproduction. Two hundred
and thirty times this set is known to have been reproduced,
and such talented weavers were given the task as
Jans and Lefebvre.</p>

<p class="caption">GOBELINS TAPESTRY. TIME OF LOUIS XV</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg&nbsp;127]</a></span>
In this exquisite period, which might be called the
adolescence of the style Louis XV, Audran and his collaborators
produced another marvellous and inspired set
of porti&egrave;res. These were executed for the Grand
Dauphin, to decorate his room in the ch&acirc;teau at Meudon,
and were called the <i>Grotesque Months in Bands</i>. The
most self-sufficient of pens would falter at a description
of design so exquisite, which is arranged in three panels
with a deity in each, a composition of extraordinary
grace above and below them, and a bordering band of
losenge or diaper, on which is set the royal double L
and the significant dolphin who gave his name to kings&rsquo;
sons. The exquisite art of Audran and of the regence
cannot be better seen than in this set of tapestries which
was woven but once at the royal factory, although repeated
many times elsewhere with the border altered,
Audran&rsquo;s being too personal for other chambers than
that of the prince for whom it was composed. Recently
copies have been made without border.</p>

<p>The name of the artist, Charles Coypel, must not be
overlooked, for it was he who composed the celebrated
suite of <i>Don Quixote</i>. Twenty-eight pieces composed
the series, and they were drawn with that exquisite combination
of romantic scenes and fields of pure decorative
design that characterised the charm of the regence. In
the centre of each piece (small pieces compared to those
of Louis XIV) was a scene like a painting representing
an incident from the adventure of the humorously pathetic
Spanish wanderer; and this was surrounded with
so much of refined decoration as to make it appear but a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg&nbsp;128]</a></span>
medallion on the whole surface. This set was so important
as to be repeated many times and occupied the
factory of the Gobelins from 1718 to 1794. Charles
Coypel was but twenty when he composed the first design
for this suite. Each year thereafter he added a new design,
not supplying the last one until 1751. But, while
all honour is due Coypel, Audran and Le Maire and
their collaborators must be remembered as having composed
the borders, the pure decorative work which expresses
the tender style of transition, the suggestive period
of early spring that later matured into the fulsome
Rococo. America is enriched by five of these exquisite
pieces through Mr. Morgan&rsquo;s recent purchase.</p>

<p>But while artists were producing purity in art, those
in political power were, with ever-increasing effect,
plunging morals into the mud. Philippe, the Regent,
died, the corrupt Duke of Bourbon took the place of minister,
and poor Louis XV was still but thirteen years old,
and unavoidably influenced by the lives of those around
him. Even the Gobelins was under the hand of the
shallow Duke d&rsquo;Antin. Yet even when the king matured
and became himself a power for corruption, the
artists of the Gobelins reflected only beauty and light.
It is to their credit.</p>

<p>It is an ungrateful task to pick flaws with a period so
firmly enthroned in the affections as that of the regence
and the early years of the reign of Louis XV. The beauties
of its pure decoration lead us into Elysian fields that
are but reluctantly left behind. But the designs and
tapestry weavers of that time left us two distinct classes
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg&nbsp;129]</a></span>
of production, and to be learned in such matters, the
amateur contemplates both. This second style is ungrateful
because it trains us away from art, delicate and ingenious,
and plants us before enormous woven paintings.</p>

<p>Now it never had been the intention of tapestry to
replace painting. Whenever it leaned that way a deterioration
was evident. It was by the lure of this fallacy
that Brussels lost her pre-eminence. It was through this
that the number of tones was increased from the twenty
or more of Arras to the twenty thousand of the Gobelins.
It was through this that the true mission of tapestry was
lost, which was the mission of supplying a soft, undulating
lining to the habitat of man, and flashes of colour for his
pageants.</p>

<p>Under Louis XIV the pictures came thick and fast, as
we have seen, but in deep-toned, simple colour-scheme.
Now, with the De Cottes as directors at the Gobelins, and
with a new reign begun, more pictures were called for.</p>

<p>The splendid <i>History of the King</i> of Louis XIV
could not be forgotten; the history of his successor must
be similarly represented, and what could this be but a
series of woven paintings. The flower of the time was
an exquisitely complicated decoration on a small scale.
The larger expression was not spontaneous.</p>

<p>Louis XV, poor boy, was not old enough to have had
many events outside the nursery, so it took imagination&mdash;perhaps
that of the elegant profligate, Duke d&rsquo;Antin&mdash;to
suggest an occasion of appropriate splendour and significance.
The official reception of the Turkish ambassador
in 1721 was the subject chosen, and under the direction
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg&nbsp;130]</a></span>
of Charles Parrocel became a superb work, full of court
magnificence of the day and a valuable portrayal to us
of the boyhood of the king.</p>

<p>The same type of big picture was continued in the series
of <i>Hunts of Louis XV</i>, lovely forest scenes wherein
much unsportsmanlike elegance displays itself in the persons
of noble courtiers. The Duc d&rsquo;Antin favoured
these and they were reproduced until 1745.</p>

<p>It is probable that the Bible fell into neglect in those
days, too heavy a volume for pointed, perfumed fingers
accustomed to no books at all. Bossuet, Voltaire, were
they not obliged to set to the sonorous music of their
voices the reforming and satirical attacks on manners and
morals of the aristocrats at a time when books lay all
unread? But at the Gobelins ateliers the Bible, wiped
clean of dust, was much consulted for inspiration in cartoons.
Charles Coypel dipped into the Old Testament,
and Jouvenet into the New, with the result of several
suites of tapestries of great elegance&mdash;all of which might
much better have been painted on canvas and framed.</p>

<p>Charles Coypel, the talented member of a talented family
of painters, also made popular the heroine <i>Armide</i>,
who seemed almost to come of the Bible, since Tasso had
set her in his Christian <i>Jerusalem Delivered</i>. The seductive
palace and entrancing gardens where Renaud
was kept a prisoner, gave opportunity for fine drawing
in this set.</p>

<p class="incaption">Gobelins, about 1730. Cartoon by J. F. de Troy; G. Audran, weaver</p>

<p>The Iliad of Homer came in for its share of consideration
at the hands of Antoine and Charles Coypel, who
made of it a set of five scenes. It was Romanelli, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg&nbsp;131]</a></span>
Italian, who painted a similar set, a hundred years before,
for Cardinal Barberini, which set came to America in
the Ffoulke collection. After the death, in 1730, of the
Duke d&rsquo;Antin, that interesting son of Madame de Montespan,
several directors had the management of the
Gobelins in hand, the Count of Vignory and the Count
of Angivillier being the most important prior to the Revolution.
These were men who held the purse-strings of
the state, and could thereby foster or crush a state institution,
but the direction of the Gobelins itself, as a factory,
was in the hands of architects, beginning with
the able De Cotte. As the factory had many ateliers,
these were each directed by painters, among whom
appear such interesting men of talent as Oudry, Boucher,
Hall&eacute;.</p>

<p>Although d&rsquo;Antin was dead when it commenced, he
is accredited with having inspired and ordered the important
hanging known as the <i>History of Esther</i>. (Plate
facing page <a href="#ESTHER_AND_AHASUERUS"><b>131</b></a>.) The first piece, from cartoons by Jean
Fran&ccedil;ois de Troy, was sent to the weavers in 1737, and the
last piece, which was painted in Rome, was finished in
1742. This set shows as ably as any can, the magnificent
style of production of the period. It had from the beginning
an immense popularity and was copied many
times. Even now it is a favourite subject for those whose
perverted taste leads them into the dubious art of copying
tapestry in paints on cloth.</p>

<p>The serious accusation against this set, which in composition
seems much like the tableaux in grand opera,
is that it invades the art of painting. And that is the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg&nbsp;132]</a></span>
fault of woven art at that period. The decline in tapestry
in Paris began when both weavers and painters struggled
for the same results, the weavers quite forgetting
the strength and beauty that were peculiar to their art
alone.</p>

<p>This fault cannot be laid to the weavers only, who numbered
such men as Neilson the able Scot, and Cozette,
who, with wondrous touch, wove the set of <i>Don Quixote</i>;
nor were the artists at fault, for they included
such men as Audran and Boucher. No, it was the
director who blighted and subverted talent, and the vitiated
public taste that shifted restlessly and demanded
novelty. The novelty that came in large hangings was
a suppressing of the delicate subjects that delight the imagination
by their playful grace, their association of
human life with all that is gaily exquisite. The mode
was for leaving the land of idealised mythology, for discarding
the flowers, the scrolls, the happy loves and
charming crew that lived among them, and for plunging
into Roman history, real and ugly, enwrapped in drapings
too full, cumbered with forced accessory, or into such
mythology as is represented in <i>Cupid and Psyche</i>.
(Plate facing page <a href="#CUPID_AND_PSYCHE"><b>132</b></a>.)</p>

<p>The <i>History of Esther</i> illustrates the loss of imagination
sustained by the border which had come to be a mere
woven imitation, in shades of brown and yellow, of a
carved and gilded, wooden frame. At the close of the
reign of Louis XV, borders were frankly abandoned altogether.
Compare this state of things with the days when
Audran and Coypel were producing the sets of <i>The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg&nbsp;133]</a></span>

<p class="caption">PORTRAIT OF CATHERINE OF RUSSIA</p>

<p class="incaption">Gobelins under Louis XVI.</p>

<p>The top note of the imitation of painting was struck
when the Gobelins set the task of becoming a portrait
maker. (Plate facing page <a href="#CATHERINE_OF_RUSSIA"><b>133</b></a>.) The work was done,
it was bound to be, as royalty backed the demand. Portraits
were woven of Louis XV (to be seen now at
Versailles), and his queen, of Louis XVI and Marie
Antoinette, and others less well known. A better scheme
for limiting the talent of the weaver could not have been
suggested by his most ingenious enemy. He was a man
of talent or his art had not reached so high, and as such
must be untrammelled; but here was given him a work
where personal discretion was not allowed, where he must
copy tone for tone, shade by shade, the myriad indefinite
blendings of the brush.</p>

<p>It is this practice, pursued to its end, that has made of
the tapestry weaver a mere part of a machine, and tapestry-making
a lost art, to remain in obscurity until weavers
return to the time before the French decadence.</p>

<p>The temper of those who hold in their hands the direction
of the people, these are the determining causes of
the products of that age. If d&rsquo;Angivillier was responsible
for displacing a transcendent art with a false one,
if he routed a dainty mythology and its accessories with
the heavy effort and paraphernalia of the Romans, on
whom shall we place the entirely supportable responsibility
of diminishing tapestries from noble draperies
down to mere furniture coverings?</p>

<p>The result came happily, with much fluttering of fans,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg&nbsp;134]</a></span>
dropping of handkerchiefs, with powder, patches, intrigues,
naughty sports, and a general necessity for a gay
company to divide itself into groups of four or two&mdash;a
lady and a cavalier, forsooth&mdash;the inevitable man and
maid. In the time of the preceding king, Louis XIV,
the court lived in masses. Life was a pageant, a grand
one, moving in slow dignity of gorgeous crowds, but a
pageant on which beat the fierce light of a throne jealous
of its grandeur. No chance was here for sweet escape
and no chance for light communing.</p>

<p>But all that saw a change. The needs of the lighter
court and the lighter people, were for reminders that life
is a merry dance in which partners change often, and sitting-out
a figure with one of them is part of the game.</p>

<p>Perhaps the huge apartments were not to the taste of
Regent Philippe, and certainly they were not convenient
to the life of the king when he came to man&rsquo;s estate. So,
down came the ceiling&rsquo;s height, and closer drew the walls,
until the model of the Petit Trianon was reached and considered
the ideal&mdash;if that were not indeed the miniature
Swiss Cottage.</p>

<p>What place had an acre of tapestry in these little rooms?
How could yards of undulating colour hang over walls
that were already overlaid with the most exquisite low
relief in wood that has ever been carved this side of the
Renaissance in Italy? No place for it whatever. So,
out with it&mdash;the fashions have changed.</p>

<p>But there was the furniture. That, too, was smaller
than hitherto. But this was the day of artists skilled in
small design, and they must fill the need.</p>

<h2 class="padtop">CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3>THE GOBELINS FACTORY (<i>Continued</i>)</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>ND so it came about that tapestry fell from the
walls, shrunk like a pricked balloon and landed
in miniature on chairs, sofas and screens.</p>

<p>How felt the artists about this domesticating of their
art? We are not told of the wry face they made when,
with ideals in their souls, they were set to compose chair-seats
for the Pompadour. Her preference was for
Boucher. Perhaps his revenge showed itself by treating
the bourgeoise courtisane to a bit of coarseness now and
then, slyly hid in dainties.</p>

<p>The artist, Louis Tessier, appeased himself by composing
for furniture a design of simple bouquets of flowers
thrown on a damask background; but, with such
surety of hand, such elegance, are these ornaments designed
and composed, that he who but runs past them
must feel the power of their exquisite beauty.</p>

<p>In this manufacture of small pieces the Gobelins factory
unhappily put itself on the same footing as Beauvais
and much confusion of the products has since resulted.
The dignity of the art was lowered when the size and
purpose of tapestries were reduced to mere furniture coverings.
The age of Louis XV, looked at decoratively,
was an age of miniature, and the reign that followed was
the same. When small chambers came into vogue,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg&nbsp;136]</a></span>
furniture diminished to suit them, and not only were walls
too small for tapestries to hang on, but chairs, sofas and
screens offered less space than ever before for woven designs,
now preciously fine in quality and minuti&aelig;.</p>

<p>Tapestry weaving now entered the region of fancy-work
for the drawing-room&rsquo;s idle hour, and we see even
the king himself, lounging idly among his favourite companions,
working at a tiny loom, his latest pretty toy.
Compare this trifling with the attitude of Henri IV and
Louis XIV toward tapestry weaving, and we have the
situation in a nutshell.</p>

<p>Louis XV passed from the scene, likewise the charming
bits of immorality who danced through his reign.
However much we may disapprove their manner of life,
we are ever glad that their taste sanctioned&mdash;more than
that&mdash;urged, the production of a decorative style almost
unsurpassed. To the artists belong the glory, but times
were such that an artist must die of suppression if those
in power refuse to patronise his art. So we are glad that
Antoinette Poisson appreciated art, and that Jeanne Verbernier
made of it a serious consideration, for, what was
liked by La Pompadour and Du Barry must needs be
favoured by the king.</p>

<p>When Louis XVI came to the throne, the return to
antiquity for inspiration had already begun, but did not
fully develop until later on, when David became court
painter under Napoleon. Yet the tonic note of decoration
was classic. Designs were still small and details
were from Greek inspiration. As tapestries were still but
furniture coverings, this was not to be regretted, for nothing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg&nbsp;137]</a></span>
could be better suited to small spaces, nor could drawing
be more exquisitely pure and chaste than when copied
from Greek detail.</p>

<p class="caption">GOBELINS TAPESTRY (DETAIL) CRAMOIS&Eacute;E. STYLE LOUIS XV</p>

<p>Count d&rsquo;Angivillier kept the Gobelins factory from all
originality, sanctioned only the small wares for original
work, and forced a slavish copying of paintings for the
larger pieces. It is not deniable that some beautiful
hangings were produced, but the sad result is that pieces
of so many tones lose in value year by year, through the
gentle, inexorable touch of time; and, more deplorable
yet, the ambition and the originality of the master-weavers
was deprived of its very life-blood, and in time was
utterly atrophied.</p>

<p>In the time of Louis XVI, when Marie Antoinette was
in the flower of her inconsiderate elegance, the note of
the day was for art to be small, but perfect; the worth of
a work of art was determined by its size&mdash;in inverse
ratio. It was a time lively and intellectual and frivolous,
and its art was the reflection of its desire for concentrated
completeness.</p>

<p>In the reign of Louis XVI ripened, not the art of Louis
XIV, but the political situation whose seeds he had
planted. The idea of revolution which started in the
little-considered American colonies, took hold of the
thinkers of France, even to the king of little power. But
instead of being a theory of remedy for important men
to discuss, it acted as a fire-brand thrown among the inflammable,
long-oppressed Third Estate&mdash;with results
deplorable to the art which occupies our attention.</p>

<p>The Gobelins was already suffering at the d&eacute;but of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg&nbsp;138]</a></span>
Revolution. Its management had been relegated to men
more or less incapable; its art standards had been forced
lower and lower. Added to that its operatives were engaged
at lessened rates and often had to whistle for their
pay at that. The contractors asked for nothing better
than to be engaged as masters of ateliers at fixed rates.</p>

<p>Then came the full force of the Revolution with such
deplorable and tragic results for the Gobelins. In the
madness of the time the workers here were not exempt
from the terrible call of Robespierre. The almoner of
the factory was arrested, and at the end of two months not
even a record existed of his execution, which took place
among the daily feasts of La Guillotine. A high-warp
weaver named Mangelschot met the same fate. Jean
Audran, once contractor for high-warp, then placed at
the head of the factory, was arrested, but escaped with
imprisonment only.</p>

<p>During his absence he was replaced as head by Augustin
Belle, whose respect for the Republic and for his
head made him curry favour with the mob in a manner
most deplorable. He caused the destruction by fire of
many and many a superb tapestry at the Gobelins, giving
as his reason that they contained emblems of royalty,
reminders of the hated race of kings. The amateur can
almost weep in thinking of this ruthless waste of beauty.</p>

<p>It was a celebrated bonfire that was built in the courtyard
of the Gobelins when, by order of the Committee on
Selection, all things offensive to an over-sensitive republican
irritability were heaped for the holocaust. As the
Gobelins was instituted by a king, patronised by kings,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg&nbsp;139]</a></span>
its works made in the main for palaces and pageants after
the taste of kings, it was only too easy to find tapestries
meet for a fire that had as object the destruction of articles
displaying monarchical power.</p>

<p>During the four horrid years when terror reigned, the
workers at the Gobelins continued under a constant
threat of a cessation of work. Not only was their pay
irregular, but it was often given in paper that had sadly
depreciated in value. Then the decision was made to
sell certain valuable tapestries and pay expenses from this
source of revenue. But, alas, in those troublous times,
who had heart or purse to acquire works of art. A whole
skin and food to sustain it, were the serious objects of
life.</p>

<p>Under the Directory, funds were scarce in bleeding
France, and all sorts of ways were used to raise them.
In the past times when Louis XIV had by relentless extravagance
and wars depleted the purse, he caused the
patiently wrought precious metals to be melted into bullion.
Why not now resort to a similar method? So
thought a minister of one of the Two Chambers, and
suggested the burning of certain tapestries of the royal
collection in order that the gold and silver used in their
weaving might be converted into metal.</p>

<p>Sixty pieces, the most superb specimens of a king&rsquo;s collection,
were transported to the court of La Monnaie,
and there burned to the last thread the wondrous work
of hundreds of talented artists and artisans. The very
smoke must have rolled out in pictures. The money
gained was considerable, 60,000 livres, showing how
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg&nbsp;140]</a></span>
richly endowed with metal threads were these sumptuous
hangings. The commission sitting by, judicial, dispassionate,
presided with cold dignity over the sacrifice, and
pronounced it good.</p>

<p>A hundred workers only remained at the Gobelins
which had once been a happy hive of more than eight
times that number, and these were constrained to follow
orders most objectionable and restrictive. Models to
copy were chosen by a jury of art, and such were its prejudices
that but little of interest remained. Ancient religious
suites, and royal ones were disapproved. New
orders consisted of portraits. But if we thought it a prostitution
of the art to weave portraits of Louis XV in royal
costume, or Marie Antoinette in the loveliness of her
queenly fripperies, what can be said of the low estate of
a factory which must give out a portrait of Marat or
Lepelletier, even though the great David painted the design
to be copied. The hundred men at the Gobelins
must have worked but sadly and desultorily over such
scant and distasteful commissioning.</p>

<p>There were works upon the looms when the Commission
began inspecting the works of art to see if they were
proper stuff for the newly-made Republic to nurse upon.
In September, 1794, they found and condemned twelve
large pieces on the looms unfinished, and on which work
was immediately suspended. Of three hundred and
twenty-one models examined, which were the property of
the factory, one hundred and twenty were rejected. In
fact, only twenty were designated as truly fit for production,
not falling under the epithets &ldquo;anti-republican,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg&nbsp;141]</a></span>
fanatic or insufficient.&rdquo; The latter description was applied
to all those exquisite fantasies of art that make the
periods Louis XV and Louis XVI a source of transcendent
delight to the lover of dainty intellectual design, and
include particularly the work of Boucher.</p>

<p>The mental and moral workings of the commission on
art may be tested by quoting from their own findings on
the <i>Siege of Calais</i>, a hanging by Berth&eacute;lemy, depicting
an event of the Fourteenth Century. This is what the
temper of the times induced the Commission&mdash;among
whom were artists too&mdash;to say: &ldquo;Subject regarded as
contrary to republican ideas; the pardon accorded to
the people of Calais was given by a tyrant through the
tears and supplications of the queen and child of a despot.
Rejected. In consequence the tapestry will be arrested
in its execution.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The models allowed in this benumbing period were
those of hunting scenes, and antique groups such as the
<i>Muses</i>, or scenes from the life of Achilles.</p>

<p>A vicious system of pay was added to the vicious system
of art restriction. And so fell the Gobelins, to revive
in such small manner as was accorded it in the Nineteenth
Century.</p>

<p>Its great work was done. It had lifted up an art which
through inflation or barrenness Brussels had let train on
the ground like a fallen flag, and it had given to France
the glory of acquiring the highest period of perfection.</p>

<p>To France came the inspiration of gathering the industry
under the paternal care of the government, of
relieving it from the exigencies of private enterprise
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg&nbsp;142]</a></span>
which must of necessity fluctuate, of keeping the art in
dignified prosperity, and of devoting to its uses the highest
talent of both art and industry.</p>

<p>The Revolution and the Directory both hesitated to kill
an institution that had brought such glory to France, that
had placed her above all the world in tapestry producing.
But what deliberate intent did not accomplish, came
near being a fact through scant rations. Operators at the
Gobelins were irregularly paid, and the public purse
found onerous the burden of support.</p>

<p>But with the coming of Napoleon the personal note was
struck again. A man was at the head, a man whose ambition
invaded even the field of decoration. The Emperor
would not be in the least degree inferior in splendour
to the most magnificent of the hereditary kings of France.
The Gobelins had been their glory, it should add to his.</p>

<p>Louis David was the painter of the court, he whose
head was ever turned over his shoulder toward ancient
Greece and Rome, who not only preferred that source of
inspiration, but who realised the flattery implied to the
Emperor by using the designs of the countries he had
conquered. It was a graceful reminder of the trophies
of war.</p>

<p>So David not only painted Josephine as a lady of Pompeii
elongated on a Greek lounge, but he set the classic
style for the Gobelins factory when Napoleon gave to
the looms his imperial patronage. It was David who had
found favour with Revolutionary France by his untiring
efforts to produce a style differing fundamentally from
the style of kings, when kings and their ways were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg&nbsp;143]</a></span>
unpopular. Technical exactness, with classic motives,
characterises his decorative work for the Gobelins.</p>

<p>The Emperor was hot for throne-room fittings that
spoke only of himself and of the empire he had built.
David made the designs, beautiful, chaste, as his invention
ever was, and dotted them with the inevitable bees
and eagles. Percier, the artist, helped with the painting,
but the throne itself was David&rsquo;s and shows his talent in
the floating Victory of the back and the conventionalised
wreaths of the seat. The whole set, important enough
to mention, embraced eight arm chairs and six smaller
ones, besides two dozen classic seats of a kingly pattern,
and screens for fire and draughts, all with a red background
on which was woven in gold the pattern of wreaths
and branches of laurel and oak.</p>

<p>The Emperor made the Gobelins his especial care. He
committed it to the discretion of no one, but was himself
the director, and allowed no loom to set up its patterns
unsanctioned by his order. Even his campaigns left this
order operative. Is it to his credit as a genius, or his discredit
as a tyrant, that the chiefs of the Gobelins had to
follow him almost into battle to get permission to weave
a new hanging?</p>

<p>Portraits were woven&mdash;but let us not dwell on that.
That portraits were woven at the Gobelins (portraits as
such, not the resemblance of one figure out of a mass to
some great personage) brings ever a sigh of regret. It
is like the evidence of senility in some grand statesman
who has outlived his vigour. It is like the portrait of your
friend done in butter, or the White House at Washington
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg&nbsp;144]</a></span>
done in a paste of destroyed banknotes. In other words,
there is no excuse for it while paint and canvas exist.</p>

<p>Napoleon&rsquo;s own portrait was made in full length twice,
and in bust ten times. The Empress was pictured at full
length and in bust, and the young King of Rome came in
for one portrait. The summit of bad art seemed reached
when it was proposed to copy in wool a painting of portrait
busts, carved in marble. This work was happily
unfinished when the empire gave place to the next form
of government.</p>

<p>It is unthinkable that Napoleon would not want his
reign glorified in manner like to that of hereditary kings
with pictured episodes, the conquests of his life, dramatic,
superb. David the court painter, supplied his canvas
<i>Napoleon Crossing the Alps</i>, and others followed.
Copying paintings was the order at the Gobelins, remember,
and that kind of work was done with infinite skill.
Numbers of grand scenes were planned, some set up on
the looms, but the great part were not done at all. Napoleon&rsquo;s
triumph was full but brief; the years of his reign
were few. He interrupted work on large hangings by
his impatience to have the throne-room furniture ready
for the reception of Europe&rsquo;s kings and ambassadors.
And when the time came that another man received in
that room, the big series of hangings which were to picture
his reign, even as the <i>Life of the King</i> pictured that
of Louis XIV, were scarcely begun.</p>

<h2 class="padtop">CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3>BEAUVAIS</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>NOTHER name to conjure with, after Gobelins
is Beauvais. In general it means to us squares of
beautiful foliage,&mdash;foliage graceful, acceptably
coloured, and of a pre-Raphaelite neatness. But it is not
limited to that class of work, nor yet to the chair-coverings
for which the factory of Beauvais is so justly celebrated.
This factory has woven even the magnificent
series of Raphael, the designs without which the Sistine
Chapel was considered incomplete. But this is anticipating,
and an inquiry into how these things came about
is a pleasure too great to miss.</p>

<p>The factory at Beauvais was founded by Colbert, under
Louis XIV, in 1664. In that respect it resembles the
Gobelins factory, but there existed an enormous difference
which had to do with the entire fate of the enterprise.
The Gobelins was founded for the king; Beauvais
was founded for commerce. The Gobelins was royally
conceived as a source of supply for palaces and
ch&acirc;teaux of royalty and royalty&rsquo;s friends. Beauvais was
intended to supply with tapestry any persons who cared
to buy them, to the end that profit (if profit there were)
should be to the good of the country.</p>

<p>So the factory was founded at Beauvais as being convenient
to Paris, although it was not known as a place
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg&nbsp;146]</a></span>
where the industry had flourished hitherto, notwithstanding
the old tapestries still in the cathedral which are accorded
a local origin in the first half of the Sixteenth
Century. And the king granted it letters patent, and
large sums of money to start the enterprise, which had
to be given a building, and men to manage it and to work
therein, and materials to work with, in fact, the duplicate
in less degree of the appropriations for the Gobelins,
except that the furniture department was omitted.</p>

<p>The idea was practically the same as that in the mind
of the paternal Henri IV when he united the scattered
factories with royal interest and patronage, but with always
the large end in view of benefiting his people
financially, as well as in the province of art. With our
modern republican views we can criticise the disinterestedness
of a monarch who maintains a factory at enormous
public expense exclusively for the indulgence of
kings.</p>

<p>And yet, it seems impossible to make both an artistic
and commercial success of a tapestry factory&mdash;at least this
is the conclusion to which one is forced in a study of the
Beauvais factory.</p>

<p>Louis Hinart was the man appointed to construct the
buildings and to stock them, and the royal appropriation
therefor, was 60,000 livres. He was to engage a hundred
workers for the first year, more to be added; and special
prizes were temptingly offered for workmen coming from
other countries, and to the contractor for each tapestry
sold for exportation.</p>

<p>Thus was trade to be encouraged, and the venture put
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg&nbsp;147]</a></span>
on its feet commercially. But alas, the factory was not
a success. Tapestries were woven, hundreds of them, and
they delight us now wherever we can find them, whether
low warp or high, whether large pieces with figures or
smaller pieces almost entirely verdure of an entrancing
kind. But the orders for large hangings, the heavy patronage
from outside France, was of the imagination only,
and the verdures for home consumption did not meet the
expenses of the factory. After twenty years of struggle,
Hinart was completely ruined and ceded the direction
of the factory to a Fleming of Tournai, Philip B&eacute;hagle.
As most of the workers were Flemish, this was probably
not disagreeable to them.</p>

<p>B&eacute;hagle, more energetic than Hinart, with a gift for
initiative, set the high-warp looms to work with extraordinary
activity. As though he would rival the great
Gobelins itself, he reproduced the most ambitious of
pieces, the Raphael series, <i>Acts of the Apostles</i>, and a long
list of ponderous groups wherein oversized gods disport
themselves in a heavy setting of architecture and voluminous
draperies. He also produced some contemporary
battle scenes which are now in the royal collection of
Sweden.</p>

<p>Not content with copying, B&eacute;hagle set up a school of
design in the factory, realising that the base of all decorative
art was design. Le Pape was the artist set over it.
From this grew many of the lovely smaller patterns which
have made the factory famous. Its garlands have ever
been inspired, and its work on borders is of exquisite conception
and execution.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg&nbsp;148]</a></span>
It is considered a great fact in the history of the factory
that the king paid it a visit in 1686; that he paraded and
rested his important person under the shade of the living
verdure in its garden. But it seems more to the point that
B&eacute;hagle made for it a success both artistic and commercial,
and this continued as long as he had breath.</p>

<p>Also was it a feather in his cap that at the time when
the Gobelins factory was sighing and dying for lack of
funds, the provincial factory of Beauvais not only remained
prosperous, but opened its doors to many of the
starving operatives from the Gobelins ateliers, thus saving
them from the horrid fate of joining the Dragonades,
as some of their fellows had done.</p>

<p>But the followers of the able B&eacute;hagle had not his capability.
After his twenty years of prosperity the factory
languished under the direction of his widow and sons,
and that of the brothers Filleul, and Micou, up to the time
when the Regent Philip was fumbling the reigns of government,
and when everything but scepticism and Les
Precieuses was sinking into feeble disintegration. The
factory became a financial failure from which the regent
had not power to lift it.</p>

<p>Again we see the name of the son of Madame de Montespan,
the Duke d&rsquo;Antin, who was at this time director
of buildings for the crown and in this capacity had the
power of choosing the directors of both the Gobelins and
Beauvais. The place of director at Beauvais was empty;
d&rsquo;Antin must have the credit of filling it wisely with the
painter Jean-Baptiste Oudry. He was a man endowed
with the sort of energy we are apt to consider modern and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg&nbsp;149]</a></span>
American. He already occupied a high place in the
Gobelins, and retained it, too, while he lifted Beauvais
from the Slough of Despond, and carried it to its most
brilliant flowering.</p>

<p class="incaption">Collection of Wm. Baumgarten, Esq., New York</p>

<p>It is only as the history of a factory touches us that
we are interested in its changes. The result of Oudry&rsquo;s
direction is one that we see so frequently in a small way
that it is agreeable to recognise its cause. Oudry was
pre-eminently a painter of animals. Add to this the
tendency to draw cartoons in suites and the demand for
furniture coverings, and at once we have the <i>raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</i>
of the design seen over and over again nowadays on old
tapestried chairs, the designs picturing the <i>Fables of La
Fontaine</i>. These were the especial work of Oudry who
composed them, who put into them his best work as animal
painter, and who set them on the looms of Beauvais many
times.</p>

<p>They had a success immediate. They became the fashion
of the day, and the pride of the factory. If the artist
had drawn with inspiration, the weavers copied with a
fidelity little short of talent. So it is not surprising that
a set of sofa and chairs on which these tapestries are displayed
brings now an average of a thousand dollars a
piece, even though the furniture frames are not excessively
rich.</p>

<p>Beauvais set the fashion for this suite, but as success
has imitators who hope for success, many factories both in
and out of France copied this series. How shall we know
the true from the false? By that sixth sense that has its
origin in a taste at once instinctive and cultivated.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg&nbsp;150]</a></span>
Oudry drew hangings for the small panelled spaces of
the walls, to accompany this set of <i>Fables</i>. He also
painted scenes from Moli&egrave;re&rsquo;s comedies, which at least
show him master of the human figure as well as of the
lines of animals.</p>

<p>We are now, it must be remembered, in the time of
Louis XV, the time of beautiful gaiety and light sarcasm,
of epigramme, and miniature, and of all that declared
itself <i>multum in parvo</i>. Therefore it was that even wall-hangings
were reduced in size and polished, so to speak,
to a perfection most admirable. Paintings were copied,
actually copied, on the looms, but however much the fact
may be deplored that tapestry had wandered far from its
original days of grand simplicity, it were unjust not to
recognise the exquisite perfection of the manner in vogue
in the middle of the Eighteenth Century, and of the perfection
of the craftsman.</p>

<p>The pieces of Beauvais that are accessible to us are
indeed charming to live with, especially the verdures of
Oudry on which he left the trace of his talent, never omitting
the characteristic fox or dog, or ducks, or pheasants
that give vital interest to a peep into the enchanted woodland.
At the same time the factory of Aubusson, and
looms in Flanders, were throwing upon the market a
quantity of verdures, of which the amateur must beware.
Oudry verdures or outdoor scenes are but few in model,
and beautifully woven.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">BEAUVAIS TAPESTRY. TIME OF LOUIS XIV</p>

<p>In the prosperity of Beauvais, ambition carried Oudry
into a gay rivalry with the Gobelins. Charles Coypel
had gained fame by a set of hangings in which scenes were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg&nbsp;151]</a></span>
taken from Don Quixote. Oudry asked himself why he
should not rival them at Beauvais. The result was a
similar series, but composed by Charles Natoire, the
artist who had drawn a set of <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i> for
the Gobelins. The same idea extended to the furniture
coverings which ran to this design as well as to the <i>Fables</i>.
Thus originated a set familiar to those of us nowadays
who covet and who buy the rare old bits that the niggard
hand of the past accords to the seeker after the ancient.</p>

<p>Exquisite indeed are the hangings by the great interpreter
of the spirit of his time, Fran&ccedil;ois Boucher. His
designs broke from the limit of the Gobelins, and were
woven at Beauvais with the care and skill required for
proper interpretation of his land of mythology. Such
flushed skies of light, such clean, soft trees waving against
them and such human elegance and beauty grouped beneath,
have seldom been reproduced in tapestry, and almost
make one wonder if, after all, the weavers of the
Eighteenth Century were not right in copying a finished
painting rather than in interpreting a decorative cartoon.
But such thoughts border on heresy and schism; away
with them.</p>

<p>Casanova, Leprince, and a host of others are tacked onto
the list of artists who painted models. We can no longer
call them cartoons, so changed is the mode for Beauvais.
But Oudry and Boucher are pre-eminent.</p>

<p>To the former, who was director as well as artist, is
attributed the fame of the factory and the resulting commercial
success. The factory had a house for selling its
wares under the very nose of the Gobelins; had another
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg&nbsp;152]</a></span>
in the enemy&rsquo;s country, Leipzig. And kings were the
patrons of these, as we know through the royal collections
in Italy, and Stockholm, where the King of Sweden was
an important collector.</p>

<p>It was in 1755 that Beauvais found itself without the
support of its leaders. Both Oudry and his partner in
business matters, Besnier, had died. And we are well on
toward the time when kingly support was a feeble and
uncertain quantity. The factory lacked the inspiration
and patronage to continue its importance.</p>

<p>In a few years more fell the blight of the Revolution.
The factory was closed.</p>

<p>It re-opened again under new conditions, but its brilliant
period was past. Will the conditions recur that can
again elevate to its former state of perfection this factory
that has given such keen delight, whose ancient works are
so prized by the amateur? It has given us thrilling examples
of the highly developed taste of tapestry weaving
of the Eighteenth Century, it has left us lovable designs
in miniature. We repulse the thought that these things
are all of the past. The factory still lives. Will not the
Twentieth Century see a restoration of its former prestige?</p>

<p>If it were only for the reproduction of the sets of furniture
of the style known as Louis XVI, the Beauvais loom
would have sufficient reason for existing at the present
day. Scenes from Don Quixote, however, and the pictured
fables of La Fontaine which we see on old chairs,
seem to need age to ripen them. These sets, when made
new, shown in all the freshness and unsoiled colour, and
unworn wool, and unfaded silk do not give pleasure.</p>

But the familiar garlands and scrolls adapted from the
Greek, that were woven for the court of Marie Antoinette,
these are ever old and ever new, like all things vital. On
a background of solid colour, pale and tawny, is curved the
foliated scroll to reach the length of a sofa, and with this
is associated garlands or sprays of flowers that any flower-lover
would worship. Nothing more graceful nor more
tasteful could be conceived, and by such work is the Beauvais
factory best known, and on such lines might it well
continue.</p>

<h2 class="padtop">CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h3>AUBUSSON</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">P</span>ERHAPS because of certain old and elegant carpets
lying under-foot in the glow and shadows of
old drawing-rooms that we love, the name of Aubusson
is one of interesting meaning. And yet history of
tapestry weaving at Aubusson lacks the importance that
gilds the Gobelins and Beauvais.</p>

<p>It just escaped that <i>sine qua non</i>, the dower of a king&rsquo;s
favour. But let us be chronological, and not anticipate.</p>

<p>If antiquity is the thing, Aubusson claims it. There is
in the town this interesting tradition that when the invincible
Charles Martel beat the enemies of Christianity and
hammered out the word peace with his sword-blade, a lot
of the subdued Saracens from Spain remained in the
neighbourhood. It was at Poitiers in 732 that the final
blow was given to show the hordes of North Africa that
while a part of Spain might be theirs, they must stop below
the Pyrenees.</p>

<p>When swords are put by, the empty hand turns to its
accustomed crafts of peace. Poitiers is a weary journey
from Africa if the land ways are hostile, and all to be
traversed afoot. Rather than return, the conquered Saracens
stayed, so runs the legend of Aubusson, and quite
naturally fell into their home-craft of weaving. They
had a pretty gift indeed to bestow, for at that time, as in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg&nbsp;155]</a></span>
ages before, the world&rsquo;s best fabrics came from the luxurious
East. And so the Saracens, defeated at Poitiers
by Charles Martel, wandered to nearby Aubusson, wove
their cloths and gave the town the chance to set its earliest
looms at a date far back in the past.</p>

<p>The centuries went on, however, without much left
in the way of history-fabric or woven fabric until we approach
the time when tapestry-history begins all over
France, like sparse flowers glowing here and there in the
early spring wood.</p>

<p>When the Great Louis, with Colbert at his sumptuous
side, was by way of patronising magnificently those arts
which contributed to his own splendour, he set his all-seeing
eye upon Aubusson, and thought to make it a royal
factory.</p>

<p>He was far from establishing it&mdash;that was more than
accomplished already, not so much by the legendary
Saracens as by the busy populace who had as early as
1637 as many as two thousand workers. Going back a
little farther we find a record of four tapestries woven
there for Rheims.</p>

<p>It was, perhaps, this very prosperity, this ability to
stand alone that made Louis and Colbert think it worth
while to patronise the works at Aubusson. But it must
be said that at this time (1664) the factory was deteriorating.
Tapestry works are as sensitive as the veriest
exotic, and without the proper conditions fail and fade.
The wrong matter here was primarily the cartoons, which
were of the poorest. No artist controlled them, and the
workers strayed far from the copy set long before.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg&nbsp;156]</a></span>
Added to that, the wool was of coarse, harsh quality and
the dyeing was badly done. All three faults remediable,
thought the two chief forces in the kingdom.</p>

<p>So Louis XIV announced to the sixteen hundred
weavers of Aubusson that he would give their works the
conspicuous privilege of taking on the name of the Royal
Manufactory at Aubusson. And, moreover, he declared
his wish to send them an artist to draw worthily, and a
master of the important craft of dyeing fast and lovely
colours.</p>

<p>Colbert drew up a series of articles and stipulations,
long papers of rules and restrictions which were considered
a necessary part of fine tapestry weaving. These
papers are tiresome to read&mdash;the constitution of many a
nation or a state is far less verbose. They give the impression
that the craft of tapestry weaving is beset with
every sort of small deceit, so protection must be the arrangement
between master and worker, and between the
factory and the great outside world, lying in wait to tear
with avaricious claws any fabric, woven or written, that
this document leaves unprotected. You get, too, the impression
that weavers took themselves a little too seriously.
There must have been other arts and crafts in the world
than theirs, but if so these men of long documents ignored
it.</p>

<p>Aubusson, then, took heart at the encouragement of the
king and his prime minister, enjoyed their fine new title
to flaunt before the world which lacked it, pored over
their new Articles of Faith, and awaited the new artist
and the new alchemist of colours.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg&nbsp;157]</a></span>
But Louis XIV was a busy man, and Paris presented
enough activity to consume all his hours but the scant
group he allowed himself for sleep. So Aubusson was
forgot. Wars and pleasures both ravaged the royal purse,
and no money was left for indulgences to a tapestry factory
lying leagues distant from Paris and the satisfying
Gobelins.</p>

<p>Then came the agitation of religious conflict during
which Louis XIV was persuaded, coerced, nagged into
the condition of mind which made him put pen to the
Revocation of the Edict of Nantes, the document that is
ever playing about the fortunes of tapestry weaving.
This was in 1685. Aubusson had struggled along on hope
for twenty years, under its epithet Royal, but now it had
to lose its best workers to the number of two hundred.
The Protestants had ever been among the best workers in
Louis&rsquo; kingdom, and by his prejudice he lost them. Germany
received some of the fugitives, notably, Pierre Mercier.</p>

<p>Near Aubusson were Felletin and Bellegarde, the three
towns forming the little group of factories of La Marche.
When the king&rsquo;s act brought disaster to Aubusson, her
two neighbours suffered equally.</p>

<p>There was also another reason for a sagging of prosperity.
Beauvais was rapidly gaining in size and importance
under the patronage of the king and the wise
rule of its administrators. Beauvais with her high-&nbsp;and
low-warp looms, her artists from Paris and her privilege
to sell in the open market, lured from Aubusson the
patronage that might have kept her strong.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg&nbsp;158]</a></span>
Thus things went on to the end of the Seventeenth Century
and the first quarter of the Eighteenth. Then in
1731 came deliverers in the persons of the painters, Jean
Joseph du Mons and Pierre de Montezert, and an able
dyer who aided them. Prosperity began anew. Not the
prosperity of the first half of the Seventeenth Century,
which was its best period, but a strong, healthy productiveness
which has lasted ever since. Two articles of faith
it adheres to&mdash;that the looms shall be invariably low, and
that the threads of the warp shall be of wool and wool
only.</p>

<p>Large quantities of strong-colour verdures from La
Marche and notably from Aubusson are offered to the
buyer throughout France. They are as easily adapted
to the wood panels of a modern dining-room as is stuff by
the yard, the pattern being merely a mass of trees divisible
almost anywhere. The colour scheme is often worked
out in blues instead of greens; a narrow border is on undisturbed
pieces, and the reverse of the tapestry is as full
of loose threads as the back of a cashmere rug. For the
most part these fragments are the work of the Eighteenth
Century. Older ones, with warmer colours introduced
bring much higher prices.</p>

<h2 class="padtop">CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<h3>SAVONNERIE</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HOSE who hold by the letter, leave out the velvety
product of La Savonnerie from the aristocratic
society of hangings woven in the classic
stitch of the Gobelins. They have reason. Yet, because
the weave is one we often see in galleries, also on furniture
both old and new, it is as well not to ignore its productions
in lofty silence.</p>

<p>Besides, it is rather interesting, this little branch of an
exotic industry that tried to run along beside the greater
and more artistic. It never has tried to be much higher
than a man&rsquo;s feet, has been content for the most part to
soften and brighten floors that before its coming were left
in the cold bareness of tile or parquet. It crept up to
the backs and seats of chairs, and into panelled screens
a little later on, but never has it had much vogue on the
walls.</p>

<p>When we go back to its beginnings we come flat against
the Far East, as is usual. The history of the fabric which
is woven with a pile like that of heavy wool velvet, and
which is called Savonnerie, runs parallel to the long story
of tapestry proper, but to make its scant details one short
concrete chronicle it is best to put them all together.</p>

<p>From the East, then, came the idea of weaving in that
style of which only the people of the East were masters.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg&nbsp;160]</a></span>
Oriental rugs as such were not attempted in either colour
or design, but one of the rug stitches was copied.</p>

<p>We have to run back to the time of Henri IV, a pleasing
time to turn to with its demonstration of how much
a powerful king loved the welfare of his people. When
he interested himself in tapestry, one of the three important
existing factories was stationed in the Louvre. This
was primarily for the hangings properly called tapestry,
but in the same place were looms for the production of
work &ldquo;after the fashion of Turkey.&rdquo; Sometimes it was
called work of &ldquo;long wool&rdquo; (<i>longue laine</i>) and sometimes
also &ldquo;<i>a la fa&ccedil;on de Perse, ou du Levant</i>,&rdquo; as well as &ldquo;of
the fashion of Turkey,&rdquo;&mdash;all names giving credit to the
East from whence the stitch came by means of crusades,
invasions and other storied movements of the people of
a dim past.</p>

<p>How long ago this stitch came, is as uncertain as most
things in the Middle Ages. We know how persistently
the cultivated venturesome East overflowed Eastern Europe,
and how religious Europe thrust itself into the East,
and on these broad bases we plant our imaginings.</p>

<p>Away back in Burgundian times there are traces of the
use of this velvet stitch. Tapestries of Germany also
woven in the Fifteenth Century, use this stitch to heighten
the effect of details.</p>

<p>But the formation of an actual industry properly set
down in history and dignified by the name of its directors,
comes in the very first years of the Seventeenth Century
when Henri IV of France was living up to his high
ideals.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg&nbsp;161]</a></span>
Pierre Dupont is the name to remember in this connexion.
He is styled the inventor of the velvet pile in
tapestry, but it were better to call him the adaptor. The
name of Savonnerie came from the building in which the
first looms were set up, an old soap factory, and thus the
velvet pile bears the misnomer of the Savonnerie.</p>

<p>Pierre Dupont (whose book &ldquo;La Stromaturgie&rdquo; might
be consulted by the book-lover) was one of the enthusiasts
included by Henri IV along with the best high-and low-warp
masters of France at that time. Being placed under
royal patronage, the Savonnerie style of weaving acquired
a dignity which it has ever had trouble in retaining
for the simple reason that the legitimate place for its
products seems to be the floor.</p>

<p>The Gobelins factory finally absorbed the Savonnerie,
but that was after it had been established in the Louvre.
Pierre Dupont who was director of tapestry works under
Henri IV even goes so far as to vaunt the works of French
production over those of &ldquo;La Turquie.&rdquo; The taste of
the day was doubtless far better pleased with the French
colour and drawing than with the designs of the East.</p>

<p>At any rate, this pretty wool velvet found such favour
with kings that even Louis XIV encouraged its continuance,
gathering it under the roof of the all-embracing
Gobelins.</p>

<p>A large royal order embraced ninety-two pieces, intended
to cover the Grand Galerie of the Louvre. Many
of these pieces are preserved to-day and are conserved by
the State.</p>

<p>If Savonnerie has never produced much that is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg&nbsp;162]</a></span>
noteworthy in the line of art, at least it has given us many
pretty bits of an endearing softness, bits which cover a
chair or panel a screen, to the delight of both eye and
touch. The softness of the weave makes it especially appropriate
to furniture of the age of luxurious interiors
which is represented by the styles of Louis XV and Louis
XVI.</p>

<p>Portraits in this style of weave were executed at a time
when portraits were considered improved by translation
into wool, but except as curiosities they are scarcely successful.
An example hangs in the New York Metropolitan
Museum of Art. (Plate facing page <a href="#SAVONNERIE"><b>162</b></a>.) In the
Gobelins factory of to-day are four looms for the manufacture
of Savonnerie.</p>

<h2 class="padtop">CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<h3>MORTLAKE</h3>

<h4>1619-1703</h4>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE three great epochs of tapestry weaving, with
their three localities which are roughly classed
as Arras in the Fifteenth Century, Brussels in the
Sixteenth Century, and Paris in the Seventeenth, had, as a
matter of course, many tributary looms. It is not supposable
that a craft so simple, when it is limited to unambitious
productions, should not be followed by hundreds
of modest people whose highest wish was to earn a
living by providing the market with what was then considered
as much a necessity as chairs and tables.</p>

<p>To take a little retrospective journey through Europe
and linger among these obscurer weavers would be delectable
pastime for the leisurely, and for the enthusiast.
But we are all more or less in a hurry, and incline toward
a courier who will point out the important spots without
having to hunt for them. Artois had not only Arras;
Flanders had not only Brussels; France had not only
the State ateliers of Paris and Beauvais; but all these
countries had smaller centres of production. The tapestries
from some of these we are able to identify, even to
weave a little history about them. These products are
recognisable through much study of marks and details
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg&nbsp;164]</a></span>
and much digging in learned foreign books, where careful
records are kept&mdash;a congenial business for the antiquary.</p>

<p>But even though we may neglect in the main the lesser
factories, there is one great development which must have
full notice. It is the important English venture known
as Mortlake.</p>

<p>Sully, standing at the elbow of Henri IV of France,
called James I of England the wisest fool in Europe. A
part of his wisdom was the encouraging in his own kingdom
the royal craft of tapestry-making. To this end he
followed the example set by that grand Henri of Navarre,
and gave the crown&rsquo;s aid to establish and maintain works
for tapestry production.</p>

<p>The elegance of the Stuart came to the front, desiring
gratification; but craftiness had a hand in the matter, too.
After the introduction of Italian luxury into England by
Henry VIII, and the continuance of art&rsquo;s revival through
the brilliant period of Elizabeth, it is not supposable that
no tapestry looms existed throughout the length and
breadth of the land at the time that James came down
from Scotland.</p>

<p>They were there; documents prove it. But they were
not of such condition as pleased the fastidious son of
Marie Stuart, who needs must import his weavers and his
artists. And therein was shown his craftiness, for he had
coaxed secretly from Flanders fifty expert weavers before
the canny Dutch knew their talented material was thus
being filched away. Every weaver was bound to secrecy,
lest the Low Countries, knowing the value of her clever
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg&nbsp;165]</a></span>
workmen, put a ban upon their going before the English
king had his full quota for the new venture.</p>

<p>Wandering about old London, one can identify now the
place where the king&rsquo;s factory had habitat. The buildings
stood where now we find Queen&rsquo;s Court Passage, and
near by, at Victoria Terrace, was the house set aside for
the limners or artists who drew and painted for the works.</p>

<p>To copy Henri IV in his success was dominant in the
mind of James I. To the able Sir Francis Crane he gave
the place of director of the works, and made with him a
contract similar to that made with Fran&ccedil;ois de la Planche
and Marc Comans in Paris by their king.</p>

<p>If to James I is owed the initial establishment, to Crane
is owed all else at that time. It was in 1619 that the
works were founded and Sir Francis took charge. He
was a gentleman born, was much seen at Court, had ambitions
of his own, too, and was cultivated in many ways of
mind and taste. Besides all this, he had a head for business
and an enthusiasm rampant, which could meet any
discouragement&mdash;and needed this faculty later, too.</p>

<p>The king then gave him the management of the venture,
started him with the royal favour, which was as good
as a fortune, with a building for the looms, with imported
workers who knew the tricks of the trade, and with a
pretty sum of money to boot.</p>

<p>Prudence was born with the enterprise; so the men from
the Low Countries were advised to become naturalised
to make them more likely to stay, and to bring other
workers over, Walloons, malcontents, religious fugitives,
or whatever, so long as the hands were skilful. Down
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg&nbsp;166]</a></span>
in Kent, they say those cottages were built for weavers,&mdash;those
lovable nests of big timbers, curved gables and small
leaded panes which we are so keen to restore and live in
these days.</p>

<p>To swell the number of workers, and to have an eye for
the future, there must be apprentices. The king looked
about among the city&rsquo;s &ldquo;hospitals&rdquo; and saw many goodly
boys living at crown expense, with no specified occupation
during their adolescence. These he put as apprentices,
for a term of seven years, to work under the fifty
Flemish leaders. They were happy if they fell under the
care of Philip de Maecht, he of Flanders, who had wandered
down to Paris and served under De la Planche and
Comans, and now had been enticed to the new Mortlake.
He has left his visible mark on tapestries of his
production&mdash;his monogram, P.D.M. (Plate facing page
<a href="#EPISODE_IN_LIFE_OF_CAESAR"><b>70</b></a>.)</p>

<p>A designer for the factory, one who lived there, was
an inseparable part of it. And thus it came that Francis
Clein (or Cleyn) was permanently established. He
came from Denmark, but had taken an enlightening journey
to Italy, and had a fine equipment for the work,
which he carried on until 1658. His name is on several
tapestries now existing.</p>

<p>Even kings tire of their fulfilled wishes. James
wanted royal tapestry works, yet, when they were an
established fact, he wearied of the drafts on his purse
for their support. It was the old story of unfulfilled
obligations, of a royal purse plucked at by too many vital
interests to spend freely on art.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg&nbsp;167]</a></span>
And Sir Francis Crane bore the brunt of the troubles.
Contracts with the king counted but lightly in face of his
enthusiasm. He continued the work, paid his men the
best he could, and let the king&rsquo;s debt to him stand unsued.</p>

<p>In a few years&mdash;a very few, as it was then but 1623&mdash;he
was obliged to petition the king. His private fortune
was gone by the board, the workmen were clamouring
for wages past due, and the factory trembled.</p>

<p>Then it was the Prince of Wales showed the value of
his interest in the tapestries that were demonstrating the
artistic enterprise of England. The Italian taste was the
ultimate note in England as well as elsewhere&mdash;the Italy
of the Renaissance; and from Italy the prince had ordered
paintings and drawings. What was more to the
purpose at this hour of leanness, he ordered paid by the
crown a bill of seven hundred pounds, which covered
their expense. The king, unwillingly,&mdash;for needs pressed
on all sides&mdash;paid also Sir Francis Crane in part for
moneys he had expended, but left him struggling against
the hard conditions of a ruined private purse and a thin
royal one.</p>

<p>At this juncture, 1625, James I died, and his son
reigned in his stead. The Prince of Wales was now become
that beribboned, picturesque, French-spirited monarch,
whose figure on Whitehall eternally protests his
tragic death.</p>

<p>As Charles I, he had the power to foster the elegant
industry which now grew and flowered to a degree that
brought satisfaction then, and which yields a harvest of
delight in our own times. Sir Francis Crane was at last
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg&nbsp;168]</a></span>
to get the reward of enthusiasm and fidelity. Too much
reward, said the envious, who tried in all ways, fair and
foul, to drive him from what was now a lucrative and
conspicuous post. The money he had advanced the factory
came back to him, and more also. Ever a well-known
figure at court, he now even aspired to closer relations
with royalty, and built a magnificent country
home, which was large enough to accommodate a visiting
court. He even persuaded the king to visit the Mortlake
factory, that the royal presence might enhance the value
of art in the occult way known only to the subjects of
kings.</p>

<p>Debts from the crown were not always paid in clinking
coin, but often in grants of land, and by these grants Sir
Francis Crane became rich. But the prosperity of Crane
was not worth our recording were it not that it evidenced
the prosperity of Mortlake. From the death of James I
in 1625 for a period of ten years, the factory flowered and
fruited. Its productions were of the very finest that have
ever been produced in any country.</p>

<p>The reasons for this superiority were evident. First
of all, Mortlake was the pet of the king; next, Crane was
an able and devoted minister of its affairs; its artistic
inspiration came from the home of the highest art&mdash;Italy&mdash;and
its weavers were from that locality of sage and able
weavers&mdash;Flanders. Add to this, tapestries were the
fashion. Every man of wealth and importance felt them
a necessary chattel to his elegance. And add to this, too,
that Mortlake had almost a clean field. It was nearly
without rival in fine tapestry-making at that time. Brussels
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg&nbsp;169]</a></span>
had declined, and the Gobelins was not formed in
its inspired combination.</p>

<p>Besides this, were not the materials for the industry
found best within the confines of the kingdom? What
sheep in all the world produced such even, lustrous wool
as the muttons huddling or wandering on the undulating
<i>pr&eacute;s sal&eacute;s</i> of Kent; and was not wool, par excellence, the
ideal material for picture-weaving, better than silk or
glittering gold?</p>

<p>The hangings made then were superb. Thanks to destiny,
we have some left on which to lavish our enthusiasm.
The cartoons preferred came from Italy&rsquo;s great dead masters.
First was Raphael. The Mortlake would try its
hand at nothing less than the great series made to finish
and soften the decoration of the Sistine Chapel. And so
the <i>Acts of the Apostles</i> were woven, and in such manner
as was worthy of them. They can be seen now in the
Garde Meuble. Van Dyck, the great Hollander, made
court painter to the king, drew borders for them, and was
proud to do it, too. Van Dyck&rsquo;s other work here was a
portrait of Sir Francis Crane and one of himself.</p>

<p>Rubens likewise associated his great decorative genius
with the factory and gave to it his suite of six designs
for the <i>Story of Achilles</i>. Cleyn, the Mortlake art-director,
furnished a <i>History of Hero and Leander</i>, which
found home among the marvellous tapestries of the King
of Sweden.</p>

<p>There were other classic subjects, and the months as
well, but of especial interest to us is the <i>Story of Vulcan</i>.
Several pieces of this series have been lent to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg&nbsp;170]</a></span>
Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, by their owners, Mrs.
von Zedlitz, and Philip Hiss, Esq. Thus, without going
far from home, thousands have been able to see these delightful
examples of the highest period of England&rsquo;s tapestry
production. The series was woven for Charles I
when he was Prince of Wales, from cartoons by Francis
Cleyn, and woven by the master, Philip de Maecht. The
borders are especially interesting, and carry the emblematic
three feathers of the prince, as well as his monogram,
in Mrs. von Zedlitz&rsquo;s example, <i>The Expulsion of Vulcan</i>.
(Coloured plate facing page <a href="#EXPULSION_OF_VULCAN"><b>170</b></a>.)</p>

<p>It was this same series of <i>Vulcan</i> that was used as a
text by Crane&rsquo;s enemy to prove to the king, in 1630, that
Crane was profiting unduly and dishonestly from the
land grants given him in payment for arrears. The
plaintiff speaks of this set as being &ldquo;the foundation of all
good tapestries in England.&rdquo; We are fortunate in having
pieces from it in America.</p>

<p>Only by actual contact with the tapestry itself can the
beauty of the colour and the work be known. We well
believe the superior quality of the English wool when it
lies before us in smooth expanse of subtle colour. And
as for even weaving, it is there unsurpassed. Every inch
declares the talent and patience of the craftsman. As for
colour, it is on a low scale that makes blues seem like remembrance
of the sea, and reds like faint flushings
planned in warm contrast, while over all is thrown a veil
of delicate mist that may be of years, or may have been
done with intent, but is there to give poetic value to the
whole of the artist&rsquo;s scheme.</p>

Sir Francis Crane died in 1636, and Captain Richard
Crane succeeded him. And then began the decline of a
factory which should have lived to save us deep regret.
This second Crane could not carry on the work, and besought
the king to relieve him by taking over the factory,
which was thenceforth known as King&rsquo;s Works.</p>

<p>But civil wars came on in 1642 and other matters were
more urgent than the production of works of art. So evil
days fell upon the weavers.</p>

<p>Then came the black day when Charles was beheaded.
The Commonwealth, to do it justice, tried to keep alive
the industry. They put at its head a nobleman, Sir Gilbert
Pickering, and, to inspire the workers, brought a
new model for design.</p>

<p>They went to Hampton Court and took from there
<i>The Triumph of C&aelig;sar</i>, by Mantegna, to serve as new
models. Some hope, too, lay in the weavers of the hour,
clever Hollanders taken prisoners in the war; and all this
while Cleyn directed.</p>

<p>But there were too many circumstances in the way, too
many hard knocks of fate. People were too poor to buy
good tapestries, and loose-woven, cheaper ones were
heavily imported&mdash;to the amount of $500,000 yearly&mdash;from
France and the Low Countries. Anti-Catholic
feeling displayed hatred toward the able Catholic weavers,
who were forced out of the country by proclamation.</p>

<p>The sad end of this story is that in 1702 a petition
was placed before the king asking permission to discontinue
the Mortlake works. It was granted in 1703, and
thus ended the English royal venture in England.</p>

<h2 class="padtop">CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<h3>IDENTIFICATIONS</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>DENTIFYING tapestries is like playing a game, like
the solving of a piquant problem, like pursuing the
elusive snark. I know of no keener pleasure than
that of standing before a tapestry for the first time and
giving its name and history from one&rsquo;s own knowledge,
and not from a museum catalogue or a friend&rsquo;s recital.
The latter sources of information may be faulty, but your
own you can trust, for by delightful association with tapestries
and their literature you have become expert. The
catalogue is to be read, the friend is to be heard, in all
humility, because these supply points that one may not
know; but, who shall not say that an intensely human
gratification is experienced when the owner of a tapestry
with the Brussels mark tells you that it is a Gobelins,
or one with the <i>History of Alexander</i> tells you it is the
only set of that series ever woven, and you know better.</p>

<p>The first thing that strikes the eye and the intelligence
is the drawing, the general school to which it belongs.
There is matter for placing the piece in its right class.
It might be said to place it in its right century or quarter
century, but that tapestries were so often repeated in later
times, the cartoon having no copyright and therefore open
to all countries in all centuries. Next, then, to fix it
better, comes a study of the border, for therein lies many
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg&nbsp;173]</a></span>
a secret of identity, and borders were of the epoch in
which the weaving was done, even though the cartoon
for the centre came from an earlier time.</p>

<p>Last, as a finishing touch, come the marks in the galloon.
This is put last because so often they are absent, and so
often unknown, the sign of some ancient weaver lost in
the mists of years, although a well-known mark so instantly
identifies, that study of other details is secondary.</p>

<p>But under these three generalising heads comes all the
knowledge of the savant, for the truth about tapestries
is most elusive. Knowledge is to be gained only by a
lover of the objects, a lover willing to spend long hours
in association with his love, prowling among collections,
comparing, handling, studying designs, discerning colours,
searching for details, and indulging withal a nice
feeling for textures, a vision that feels them even without
touch of the hand.</p>

<p>If the study of design has not given a keen scent for
the vague quality which we call &ldquo;feeling,&rdquo; the eye would
better be trained still further, for herein lies the secret of
success in difficult places, and not only that, but if he
have not this sense he is deprived of one of the most
subtile thrills that the arts can excite.</p>

<p>But this sense is not a matter of untrained intuition.
It is the flower of erudition, the flame from a full heart,
or whatever dainty thing you choose to call it. It has its
origin primarily in keen observation of the various important
schools of design that have interested the world
for centuries. We unconsciously augment it even in following
the side-path of history in this modest volume.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg&nbsp;174]</a></span>
Our studies here are but those of a summer morn or a
winter eve, yet they are in vain if they have not set up
a measuring standard or two within the mind.</p>


<h4>GOTHIC DRAWING</h4>

<p>First, and dearest to the lover of designs, comes the
Gothic, the style practised by those conscientious romantic
children-in-art, the Primitives. Their characteristics
in tapestry are much the same as in painting, as in
sculpture; for, weavers, painters, book-makers, sculptors,
were all expressing the same matter, all following the
same fashion. Therefore, to one&rsquo;s help comes any and
every work of the primitive artists. Making allowance
for the difference in medium, the same religious feeling
is seen in the Burgundian set of <i>The Sacraments</i> in the
Metropolitan Museum of Arts, New York, as is found
in stone carving of the time which decorated churches and
tombs.</p>

<p>The figures in the Gothic tapestries show a dignified
restraint, a solemnity of pose, recalling the deadly seriousness
with which children play the game of grown-ups.
The artists of that day had to keep to their traditions; to
express without over-expression, was their difficult task
(as it is ours), but they had behind them the rigidity of
the Byzantine and Early Christian, so that every free line,
every vigorous pose or energetic action, was forging
ahead into a new country, a voyage of adventure for the
daring artist. Quite another affair was this from modern
restraint which consists in pruning down the voluptuous
lines following the too high Renaissance.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg&nbsp;175]</a></span>
Faces are serious, but not animated. Dress reveals
charming matter concerning stuffs and modes in that far
time. But apart from these characteristics is the one
great feature of the arrangement of the figures, almost
without perspective. And therein lies one immense superiority
of the ancient designs of tapestries over the modern
as pure decorative fabric. Men and women are
placed with their accessories of furniture or architecture
all in the foreground, and each man has as many cubits
to his stature as his neighbour, not being dwarfed for
perspective, but only for modesty, as in the case of the
Lady&rsquo;s companion in the <i>Unicorn</i> series&mdash;but that series
is of a later Gothic time than the early works of Arras.</p>

<p>A noticeable feature is that the centre of vision is
placed high on the tapestry. The eye must look to the
top to find all the strength of the design. The lower part
is covered with the sweeping robes or finished figures of
the folk who are playing their silent parts for the delight
of the eye. This covers well the space with large and
simple motive. No recourse is had to such artifice as
distant lands seen in perspective, nor angles of rooms, but
all is flat, brought frankly into intimate association with
the room that is lived in, so that these people of other
days seem really to enter into our very presence, to thrust
vitally their quaint selves into our company. This feature
of simple flatness is in so great contrast to later methods
of drawing that one becomes keenly conscious of it,
and deeply satisfied with its beauty. The purpose of decoration
and of furnishing seems to be most adequately
met when the attention is retained within the chamber and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg&nbsp;176]</a></span>
not led out of it by trick of background nor lure of perspective,
no matter how enticing are the distant landscapes
or how noble the far palace of royalty. Thus the
Primitives struck a more intimately human note than the
artists of later and more sophisticated times.</p>

<p>The more archaic the tapestry, the simpler the motive,
is the rule. The early weavers of Arras and of France
were telling stories as naturally as possible, perhaps because
the ways of their times were simple, and brushed
aside all filigree with a directness almost brutal; but also,
perhaps, because technique was not highly developed,
either in him who drew with a pencil or him who copied
that drawing in threads of silk and wool and gold.
Whatever the cause, we can but rejoice at the result,
which, alas, is shown to us by but lamentably few remnants
outside of museums. These very archaic simple
pieces are, for the most part, work of the latter part of
the Fourteenth Century and the first part of the Fifteenth,
and as the history of tapestry shows, were almost invariably
woven in France or in Flanders. At the end of the
time mentioned, designs, while retaining much the same
characteristics already described, became more ambitious,
more complicated, and introduced many scenes into one
piece. This is easily proved by a comparison of the illustration
of <i>The Baill&eacute;e des Roses</i>, or <i>The Sacraments</i>, with
<i>The Sack of Jerusalem</i>, all in the Metropolitan Museum.</p>

<p>The idea in the earliest Gothic cartoons&mdash;if the word
may be allowed here, was to make a single picture, a
unified group. Into the later cartoons came the fashion
of multiplying these groups on one field, so that a tapestry
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg&nbsp;177]</a></span>
had many points of interest, many scenes where tragedies
or comedies were being enacted. Ingenious were the
ways of the early artist to accomplish the separation between
the various scenes, which were sometimes divided
merely by their own attitudes, as folk dispose themselves
in groups in a large drawing-room; and sometimes were
divided by natural obstructions, like brooks and trees, or
by columns.</p>

<p>Later yet, all the antique eccentricities passed away,
and the laws of perspective and balance were fully developed
in an art which has an unspeakable charm. All the
things that modern art has decreed as crude or childish
has passed away, and the sweet flower of the Gothic perfection
unfolded its exquisite beauty. This Gothic
perfection was the Golden Age of tapestry.</p>


<h4>ARCHITECTURAL DETAIL</h4>

<p>The use of architecture in the old Gothic designs makes
a pleasing necessity of fastening our attention upon it.
In the very oldest drawing the sole use is to separate one
scene from another, in the same hanging. For this purpose
slender columns are used. It is intensely interesting
to note that these are the same variety of column that
meets us on every delightful prowl among old relics of
North Europe, relics of the days when man&rsquo;s highest and
holiest energy expressed itself at last in the cathedral.
Those slender stems of the northern Gothic are verily the
stems of plants or of aspiring young trees, strong when
grouped, dainty when alone, and forming a refined division
for the various scenes in a picture. It must be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg&nbsp;178]</a></span>
confessed that in the medium of aged wool they sometimes
totter with the effect of imminent fall, but that they do not
fall, only inspires the illusion that they belong to the marvellous
age of fairy-tale and fancy.</p>

<p>The careful observer takes a keen look at these columns
as a clue to dates. The shape of the shaft, whether round
or hectagonal, the ornament on the capitals, are indications.
It is not easy to know how long after a design is
adopted its use continues, but it is entirely a simple matter
to know that a tapestry bearing a capital designed in 1500
could not have been made prior to that time.</p>

<p>The columns, later on, took on a different character.
They lifted slender shafts more ornamented. It is as
though the restless men of Europe had come up from the
South and had brought with them reminiscences of those
tender models which shadowed the art of the Saracens,
the art which flavoured so much the art of Southern Europe.
The columns of many a cloister in Italy bear just
such lines of ornament, including the time when the
brothers Cosmati were illuminating the pattern with their
rich mosaic.</p>

<p>Then, later still, the columns burst into the exquisite
bloom of the early Renaissance, their character profoundly
different, but their use the same, that of dividing
scenes from one another on the same woven picture. But
as any allusion to the Renaissance seems to thrust us far
out onto a radiant plain, let us scamper back into the mysterious
wood of the Gothic and pick up a few more of its
indicative pebbles, even as did Hans and Gretel of fairyland.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg&nbsp;179]</a></span>
A use of Gothic architectural detail gives a religious
look to tapestry, quite other than the later introduction of
castles. These castle strongholds of the Middle Ages
wasted no daintiness of construction, nor favoured light
ornament, nor dainty hand. They were, par excellence,
places of defence against the frequent enemy; so, in bastion
and tower they were piled in curving masses around
the scenes of the later Gothic tapestries. Even more,
they began to play an important part in the <i>mise en sc&egrave;ne</i>,
and were drawn on tiny scale as habitations of the actors
in the play who thrust heads from windows no larger than
their throats, or who gathered in gigantic groups on disproportioned
tessellated roofs.</p>

<p>Occasionally a lovely lady in distress is seen in fine
raiment praying high Heaven for deliverance from the
top of a feudal pile not half as high as her stately figure.
Laws of proportion are quite lost in this na&iuml;ve way of
telling a story, and one wonders whether the wise old
artist of other times, with his rigid solemnity was heroically
overcoming difficulties of traditional technique, or
whether he was smiling at the infantile taste of his
wealthy patrons. The past fashion in history was to record
only the lives and expressions of those great in
power. The artist is ever the servant of such, but may
he not have had his own private thoughts, unpurchaseable,
unsold, and therefore only for our divining. There
must have been a sense of humour then as now, and
twinkling eyes with which to see it.</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg&nbsp;180]</a></span></p>

<h4>GOTHIC FLOWERS</h4>

<p>Always, in studying a Gothic tapestry, we find flowers.
The flowers of nature, they are, a simple nature at that,
and never to be thought of in the same day as the gorgeous,
expansive, proud flowers of the Seventeenth and
Eighteenth Century decoration. Those splendid later
blossoms flaunt their richness with assured swagger and
demand of man his homage, quite forgetting it is the flower&rsquo;s
best part to give.</p>

<p>Botticelli had not outgrown the Gothic flowers when
he sprinkled them on the ambient air and floating robe
of his chaste and dreamy <i>Venus</i>, nor when he set them
about the elastic tripping feet of the <i>Spring</i>. He knew
their simple power, and so do we. Scarce a Gothic tapestry
is complete without them, happily for those bent on
identification, for rarely can one discover them without
the same thrill that accompanies the discovery of the first
violets and snowdrops in the awakening woods.</p>

<p>The old weavers set them low in the picture, used them
as space-fillers wherever space lay happily before them,
and they never exaggerated their size, a virtue of which
the full Renaissance cannot boast. They are the simplest
sort of flowers, the corolla of petals turning as frankly toward
the observer as the sunflower turns toward her god,
and little bells hanging as regularly as a chime. These
are their characteristics, easily recognisable and expressing
the unsophisticated charm of the creations of honest
childish hands. Irrelevancy is theirs, too. They spring
from stones or pavement as well as from turf or garden,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg&nbsp;181]</a></span>
and thus express the more ardently their love for man and
for close association with him. When they are seen after
this manner, it is sure that the early men have set them,
just as Shakespeare, at the same epoch, set violets blue
and daisies pied, cowslip, rosemary &ldquo;for remembrance,&rdquo;
and other familiar dainties, in the grim foundation stones
of his tragedies.</p>

<p>A comparison of the different hangings available to the
amateur, or of the pictured examples given in this book,
will reveal more than can be well set down with the pen.
The use of flowers in the set of <i>The Baill&eacute;e des Roses</i> is
exceptional, in that here the flowers form a harmonious
decorative scheme and are at the same time an important
part of the story which is pictured.</p>

<p>In other earliest examples they playfully peep within
the limits of the hanging. Important use is, however,
made of them in that altogether entrancing set of <i>The
Lady and the Unicorn</i>, where they indicate the beauties
of a fascinating park in which the delicate lady and her
attendant led a wondrous life guarded by two beasts as
fabulous as faithful, and the whole region of leaves and
petals but serving as a paradise for delectable white rabbits
and piquant monkeys. Could any modern indicate
by sophistry of brush or brain so intoxicating a fairyland,
so gracious a field of dear delights?</p>


<h4>COSTUMES</h4>

<p>A minute study of all the details of costume and accessories
is one of the measuring sticks with which we count
the years of a tapestry&rsquo;s life. This applies more particularly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg&nbsp;182]</a></span>
to the work prior to the Renaissance, to the time
when all characters were dressed in the mode of the day&mdash;another
evidence of that ingenuousness that delights us
who have passed the period where it is possible.</p>

<p>As we have noted before, a costume cannot be used
before its time, so, as much as anything can, the study of
its details prevents us from going too far back with its
date. When one has reached the point of identifying a
Gothic tapestry to where the exact decade is questioned,
the century having been ascertained, a careful study of
costumes outside the region of tapestries is necessary.
This leads one into a department all by itself and means
delightful hours in libraries poring over illustrated books
on costume. It means to learn in what manner our gods
and heroes of fact and fancy habited themselves, how
Berengaria wore her head-dress and Jehane de Bourgogne
her brocades, and how the eternally various sleeve
differed in its fashioning for both men and women.</p>

<p>Head-dresses were of such size and variety that they
form a study in themselves, and dates have been fixed by
these alone. The turban in its evolution is an interesting
study, and makes one wonder if that, too, did not wander
north from the Moorish occupancy of Spain and the wave
of inspiration which flowed unceasingly from the Orient
in the years when Europe created little without inspiration
from outside.</p>

<p>A patriarchal bearded man in sacerdotal robes of costly
elegance seriously impresses his fellows all through the
Gothic tapestries, and his rival is a swaggering, important
person, clean-shaven, in full brocaded skirt,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg&nbsp;183]</a></span>
fur-bound, whose attitude declares him royal or near it. The
first of these is the model nowadays for stage kings, and
even a woman&rsquo;s toilet must vaunt itself to get notice beside
his gorgeous array. He wears about his waist a
jewelled girdle of great splendour, and on his head some
impressive matter of either jewels or draping. His face
is usually full-bearded, but even when smooth, youth is
not expressed upon him. Youths of the same time are
more <i>d&eacute;bonnaire</i>, are springing about, clean-faced, clad
in short, belted pelisse, showing sprightly legs equally
ready to step quickly towards a lovely lady or to a field of
battle.</p>

<p>Soldiers&mdash;let a woman hesitate to speak of their dress
and arms in any tone but that of self-depreciating humility.
Suffice it to say that in the early work they wore the
armour of the time, whether the scene depicted were an
event of history cotemporaneous, or of the time of Moses.
Fashions in dress changed with deliberation then, and it
is to the arms carried by the men that we must sometimes
look for exactness of date.</p>


<h4>LETTERING</h4>

<p>The presence of letters is often noticed in hangings of
the Fourteenth, Fifteenth and early Sixteenth Centuries.
It was a fashion eminently satisfactory, a great assistance
to the observer. It helped tell the story, and, as these old
pictures had always a story to tell, it was entirely excusable&mdash;at
least, so it seems to one who has stood confounded
before a modern painting without a catalogue or other
indication as to the why of certain agitated figures.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg&nbsp;184]</a></span>
The lettering was, in the older Gothic, explicit and
unstinted, in double or quadruple lines, in which case it
counts as decoration banded across top or bottom.
Again, it is as trifling as a word or two affixed to the
persons of the play to designate them. This lettering
may be French or Latin.</p>


<h4>EARLY BACKGROUNDS</h4>

<p>Backgrounds of the early Fifteenth Century deal much
in conventionalised, flat patterns, but fifty or sixty years
later, when figures began to be more crowded, there was
but little space left unoccupied by the participants in the
allegory, and this was filled by the artifices of architecture
or herbage that formed the divisions into the various
scenes. Later the designing artists decided to let into the
picture the light of distant fields and skies, and thus was
introduced the suggestion of space outside the limit of the
canvas.</p>


<h4>LATER DRAWING</h4>

<p>After the Gothic drawing, came the avalanche of the
Renaissance. That altered all. The Italian taste took
precedence, and from that time on the cartoons of tapestries
represent modern art, trailing through its various
fashions or modes of the hour. The purest Renaissance
is direct from the Italian artist, in tapestry as well as in
painting, but it is interesting to see the maladroitness of
the Flemish hand when left to draw cartoons for himself
after the new manner.</p>

<p>After the Renaissance came exaggeration and lack of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg&nbsp;185]</a></span>
sincerity; then the improvement of the Seventeenth Century,
notably in France, and after that the dainty fancies
of the Eighteenth Century, and here we are dealing with
art so modern that it needs no elucidation. The drawing
in tapestries is a subject as fascinating as it is inexhaustible,
but, however much one may read on it, nothing equals
actual association with as many tapestries as are available,
for the eye must be trained by vision and not by intellectual
process alone.</p>

<h3>IDENTIFICATIONS (<i>Continued</i>)</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>F the amateur can have the fortune to see in the same
hour a tapestry of the early Fifteenth Century, and
one a hundred years later, and then one about 1550,
from Brussels, drawn by an Italian artist, he has before
him an exposition of tapestry weaving in its golden age
when it sweeps through its greatest periods and phases to
marvellous perfection. The earliest example gives acquaintance
with that almost fabled time of the Gothic
primitives in art; the second shows the highest development
of that art under the influence of civilisation, and
the third shows the obsession of the new art of the Renaissance.
It is, perhaps, superfluous to say that after the
revival of classic art the power of producing spontaneous
Gothic was lost forever. From that time on, every drawing
has had certain characteristics, certain sophistications
that the artist cannot escape except in a deliberate copy.</p>

<p>Modern art, we call it. In tapestry it began with a
freedom of drawing in figures, and an adoption of classic
ornament and architecture. In this connexion it is interesting
to note the introduction of Greek or Roman
detail in the columns that divide the scenes, to see saints
gathered by temples of classic form instead of Gothic.
If Renaissance details appear in a hanging called Gothic,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg&nbsp;187]</a></span>
it is easy to see that the piece was woven after Europe
was infected with modern art, and this is an assistance in
placing dates; at least, it checks the tendency to slip back
too far in antiquity, a tendency of which we in a new
country are entirely guilty.</p>

<p>Lest too long a lingering on the subject of design become
wearisome, a mention of later designs is made
briefly. The simplicity of the early Renaissance, the
perfection of the high Renaissance, are both shown in
tapestry as well as in paintings, and so, too, is exemplified
the inflation that ended in tiresome exuberance.</p>

<p>After the fruit was ripe it fell into decay. After Sixteenth
Century perfection, Seventeenth Century designs
fell of their own overweight, figures were too exaggerated,
draperies billowed out as in a perpetual gale,
architecture and landscapes were too important, and tapestries
became frankly pictures to attract the attention.
To this class of design belong all those monstrosities
which reflected and distorted the art of Raphael, and
which have been intimately associated with Scriptural
subjects down to our own times.</p>

<p>After Raphael, Rubens. Familiarity with this heroic
painter is the key to placing all the magnificent designs
similar to the set of <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i> (Metropolitan
Museum of Art in New York).</p>

<p>Then came the easily recognisable designs of the
French ateliers of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries.
These are so frequently brought before us as to
seem almost like products of our own day. The earlier
ones seem (as ever) the purer art, the less sensual, appealing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg&nbsp;188]</a></span>
to the more impersonal side of man, dealing in battles
and in classic subjects. Later, the drawings, becoming
more directly personal, in the time of Louis XIV portrayed
events in the <i>Life of the King</i>; in the next reign,
slipping into the pleasures of the <i>Royal Hunts</i>, from
which the descent was easy into depicting nothing higher
than the soft loveliness of the fantastic life of the time as
led by those of high estate. From Lebrun to Watteau
one can trace the gradual seductive decline, where heroic
ideal lowers softly in alluring decadence into a mere
tickling of the senses. And at this time the productions
of great tapestries stopped.</p>

<p>Before leaving the review of drawing or design, it is
well to recall that the fleeting fashions of the day usually
set the models, not in the manner of treatment which we
have been considering broadly, but in the subject of designs.
For example, the tendency to religious and morality
subjects in the Gothic, the love for Greek gods and
heroes in the Renaissance, the glorification of kings and
warriors at all times, and the portrayal of royal pleasures
in modern times. The months of the year were woven in
innumerable designs and formed an endless theme for
artists&rsquo; ingenuity during and after the Renaissance.</p>


<h4>BORDERS</h4>

<p>It is but natural that, with the expansion in drawing,
the freedom given the pencil, imagination leaped outside
the pictured scene and worked fantastically on the border,
and it is to the border that we turn for many a mark of
identification. The subject being a full one, it has longer
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg&nbsp;189]</a></span>
consideration in a separate chapter. First there is the simple
outlying tape, then the designed border. The early
Gothic was but a narrow line of flowers and berries; the
later more sophisticated Gothic enlarged and elaborated
this same motive without introducing another. The blossoms
grew larger, the fruit fuller and the modest cluster
of berries was crowded by pears, apples and larger fruit,
until a general air of full luxury was given. The design
was at first kept neatly within bordering lines of tape, but
later, overleaped them with a flaunting leaf or mutinous
flower.</p>

<p>Ribbons appeared early, then came fragmentary
glimpses of dainty columns which gave nice reasons for
the erect upstanding of so heavy a decoration. These all
were Gothic, but what came after shows the riotous
imagination of the Renaissance. It seemed in that fruitful
time, space itself were not large enough to hold the
designs within the artist&rsquo;s brain. Certainly no corner of
a tapestry could be left unfilled, and not that alone, but
filled with perfect pictures instead of with a simple repeated
scheme of decoration. It was in this rich time
of production that the borders of tapestries grew to exceeding
width, and were divided into squares, each
square containing a scene. These scenes were often of
sufficient importance in composition to serve as models
for the centre of a tapestry, each one of them, which
thought gives a little idea of the fertility of the artists
in that untired period.</p>

<p>It was the delight of the great Raphael himself to expend
his talent on the border of his cartoons. From this
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg&nbsp;190]</a></span>
artist others took their cue with varying skill, but with
fine effect, and with unlimited interest to us. Those who
run have time to remark only the great central picture
in a hanging; but, to those who live with it, this added
line of exquisite panorama is an unceasing delight for the
contemplative hours of solitude. From this rich departure
from Gothic simplicity the artists grew into the same
fulness of design that ended in decadence. The border
became almost obnoxious in its inflated importance and
from voluptuous elegance changed to coarse overweight;
and by these signs we know the early inspired work from
its rank and monstrous aftergrowth in the Eighteenth
Century.</p>

<p>A quick glance at the plates showing the work of tapestry&rsquo;s
next highwater mark, the hundred years of the
Gobelins&rsquo; best work, illustrates the difference between
that time and others, and shows also the gradual drop into
the border which is merely a woven representation of a
gilded wood frame to enclose the woven picture as
a painted one would be framed. The <a href="#ESTHER_AND_AHASUERUS"><b>plate</b></a> of <i>Esther and
Ahasuerus</i> illustrates this sort of border in the unmistakable
lines of Louis XV ornament.</p>


<h4>POINT OF INTEREST</h4>

<p>Allusion has been made to the placing of the point of
interest in a tapestry, but this is a matter to be studied
by much exercise of the eye. Perhaps the amateur knows
already much about it, an unconscious knowledge, and
needs only to be directed to his own store of observations.
As much as anything this change of design depended on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg&nbsp;191]</a></span>
the uses the varying civilisation made of the hangings.
So much interest lies in this that I find myself ever prone
to recapitulate the very human facts of the past; the lining
of rude stone walls and the forming of interior doors,
which was the office of the early tapestries, and the loose
full draping of the same; then the gradual increase of
luxury in the finish of dwellings themselves, until tapestries
were a decoration only; and then the minimising of
grandeur under Louis XV when everything fell into
miniature and tapestries were demanded only in small
pieces that could be applied to screens or chairs&mdash;a prostitution
of art to the royal demand for prettiness.</p>

<p>Keeping these general ideas of the uses of tapestries in
mind, it is easy to reason out the course of the point of
interest in the design. The Gothic aim was to make
warm and comfortable the austere apartment; the Renaissance
sought to produce big decorative pictures to hang
in place of frescoes; and the French idea&mdash;beginning with
that same ideal&mdash;fell at last into the production of something
that should accompany the other arts in making
minutely ornate the home of man. Therefore, the
Gothic artist placed the point of interest high; the artists
of the Renaissance followed the rules of modern painting
(even to the point of becoming academic); and the last
good period of the Gobelins dropped into miniature and
decoration.</p>


<h4>COLOURS</h4>

<p>Colours we have not yet considered, in this chapter of
review for identification&rsquo;s sake. They follow the same
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg&nbsp;192]</a></span>
line, have the same history, and this makes the beauty, the
logic and the consistency of our work, the work of tracing
to their source the products of other men and other times.</p>

<p>Colours in the early Gothic&mdash;of what do they remind
one so strongly as of the marvels of old stained glass, that
rich, pure kaleidoscope which has lived so long in the
atmosphere of incense ascending from censer and from
heart. The same scale, rich and simple, unafraid of unshaded
colour, characterise both glass and tapestry.</p>

<p>The dyeing of colours in those days was a religion, a
religion that believed in holding fast to the forefathers&rsquo;
tenets. Red was known to be a goodly colour, and blue
an honest one; yellow was to conjure with, and brown to
shade; but beyond twelve or perhaps twenty colours, the
dyer never ventured. To these he gave the hours of his
life, with these he subjugated the white of Kentish wool,
and gave it honest and soft into the hand of the artist-weaver
who, we must add, should have been thankful for
this brief gamut. To say the least, we of to-day are grateful,
for to this we owe the effect of cathedral glass seen in
old tapestries like that of <i>The Sacraments</i>. The Renaissance
having more sophisticated tales to tell, a higher intellectual
development to portray, demanded a longer
scale of colour, so more were introduced to paint in wool
the pictures of the artists. At first we see them pure and
true, then muddy, uncertain, until a dull confusion comes,
and the hanging is depressing. When, at the last, it came
that a tapestry was but a painting in wool, with as many
thousand differently united threads as would reproduce
the shading of brush-blended paint, the whole thing fell
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg&nbsp;193]</a></span>
of its own weight, and we of to-day value less the unlimited
pains of the elaborate dyer and weaver than we do
the simpler work. The reason is plain. Time fades a
little even the securest dyes, and that little is just enough
to reduce to flat monotones a work in which perhaps sixty
thousand tones are set in subtle shading.</p>


<h4>HAUTE LISSE</h4>

<p>The worker on tapestries, the modern restorer&mdash;to
whom be much honour&mdash;finds a sign of identification in
the handling of old tapestries that is scarcely within the
province of the amateur, but is worth mentioning. It is
the black tracing on the warp with which high-warp
weavers assist their work of copying the artist&rsquo;s cartoon.
Where this is present, the work is of the prized haute lisse
or high-warp manufacture, instead of the basse lisse or
low-warp. But the latter is not to be spoken of disparagingly,
for in the admirable time of French production
about the time of the formation of the Gobelins, low-warp
work was almost as well executed as high-warp, and as
much valued. Brussels made her fame by haute-lisse, but
in France the low-warp was dubbed &ldquo;<i>&aacute; la fa&ccedil;on de Flandres</i>&rdquo;;
and as Flanders stood for perfection, the weavers
did their best to make the low-warp production approach
in excellence the famed work of the ateliers to the north,
which had formerly so prospered.</p>

<p>To find this black line is to establish the fact that the
tapestry was woven on a high-warp loom, if nothing more.
But that in itself means, as is explained in the chapter on
looms and <i>modus operandi</i>, that a superior sort of weaver,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg&nbsp;194]</a></span>
an artist-artisan, did the work, and that he had enormous
difficulties to overcome in his patient task.</p>

<p>A black outline woven in the fabric is one which artists
prior to the Seventeenth Century used to give greater
strength to figures. It was the habit thus to trace the
entire human form, to lift it clearly from its background,
after the &ldquo;poster&rdquo; manner of to-day. It is as though a
dark pencil had outlined each figure. This practice
stopped in later years, and is not seen at all in the softer
methods of the Gobelins.</p>


<h4>THE WEAVE</h4>

<p>The materials of tapestries we know to be invariably
wool, silk and metal threads, yet the weaving of these
varies with the talent of the craftsman. The manner of
the oldest weavers was to produce a fabric not too thick,
flexible rather&mdash;for was it not meant to hang in folds?&mdash;and
of an engagingly even surface. It was not too fine,
yet had none of the looseness associated with the coarse,
hurried work of later and degenerate times. It was more
like the even fabric we associate with machine work, yet
as unlike that as palpitating flesh is like a graven image.
It was the logical production of honest workmen who
counted time well spent if spent in taking pains.</p>

<p>This ability, to take detail as a religion, has left us the
precious relics of the exquisite period immediately before
the Italian artists had their way in Brussels. Notice the
weave here. See the pattern of the fabrics worn by the
personages of high estate. You could almost pluck it
from the tapestry, shake out its folds, measure it flat, by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg&nbsp;195]</a></span>
the yard, and find its delicate, intelligent pattern neat and
unbroken. Wonderful weaver, magic hands, infinite
pains, were those to produce such an effect on our sated
modern vision, all with a few threads of silk and wool
and gold.</p>

<p>Then there is the human face&mdash;it takes an artist to describe
the various faces with their beauty of modelling,
their infinite variety of type, their subtlety of expression.
You can almost see the flushing of the capillaries under
the translucent skin, so fine are the mediums of silk and
wool under the magic handling of the talented weavers in
brilliant epochs. Not a detail in one of these older canvases
of the highest Gothic development has been neglected.</p>

<p>The modern places his point of interest, and, knowing
the observer&rsquo;s eye is to obediently linger there, he splashes
the rest of his drawing into careless subserviency. But
these careful older drawings showed in every inch of their
execution a conscience that might put the Puritan to
shame. Note, even, the ring that is being handed to the
lady in the Mazarin tapestry of Mr. Morgan&rsquo;s (if yours
is the happy chance to see it). It was not sufficient for
the weaver that it be a ring, but it must be a ring set with
a jewel, and that jewel must be the one celebrated ever
for its value; so in the canvas glows a carefully rounded
spot of pigeon-blood.</p>

<p>This exquisitely fine weaving of the period which trembled
between the Gothic and the Renaissance made possible
the execution of the later work&mdash;and yet, and yet,
who shall say that the later is the superior work?
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg&nbsp;196]</a></span>
Vaunted as it is, one turns to it because one must, but with
entire fidelity of heart for the preceding manner.</p>

<p>In the high period of Brussels production, when the
Renaissance was well established there, through the cartoons
of the Italian artists, it is interesting to note the richness
given to surfaces solidly filled in with gold by
throwing the thread in groups of four. The light is thus
caught and reflected, almost as though from a heap of cut
topaz. This characterises the tapestries of the <i>Mercury</i>
series in the Blumenthal collection.</p>

<p>Naturally, the evenness of the weaving has much to do
with the value of the piece&mdash;otherwise the pains of the
old weavers would have been futile. The surface smooth,
free from lumps or ridges, strong with the even strength
of well-matched threads, this is the beauty that characterises
the best work this side of the Fifteenth Century.</p>

<p>It is the especial prerogative of the merchant to touch
with his own hands a great number of tapestries. It is
by this handling of the fabric that he acquires a skill in
determining the make of many a tapestry. There is an
indefinable quality about certain wools, and about the
manner of their weaving that is only revealed by the touch.
Not all hands are wise to detect, but only those of the
sympathetic lover of the materials they handle&mdash;and I
have found many such among the merchant collector.
But even he finds identification a task as difficult as it is
interesting, and spends hours of thought and research before
arriving at a conclusion&mdash;and even then will retract
on new evidence.</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg&nbsp;197]</a></span></p>

<h4>COPIES</h4>

<p>There are certain pitfalls into which one may so easily
fall that they must never be out of mind. The worst of
these, the pit which has the most engaging and innocent
entrance, is that of the copy, the modern tapestry copied
from the old a few decades ago.</p>

<p>It is easy to find by reference to the huge volumes of
French writers on tapestry just when certain sets of cartoons
were first woven. Take, for example, the <i>Acts of
the Apostles</i> by Raphael; Brussels, 1519, is the authentic
date. But after that the Mortlake factory in England
wove a set, and others followed. This instance is too historic
to be entirely typical, but there are others less known.
It was the habit of factories that possessed a valuable set
of cartoons to repeat the production of these in their own
factory, and also to make some arrangement whereby
other factories could also produce the same set of hangings.</p>

<p>In the evil days that fell upon Brussels after her apogee,
copying her own works took the place of new matters.
Also, in the French factories in their prime, the same set
was repeated on the same looms and on different ones,
<i>vide The Months</i>, <i>The Royal Residences</i>, <i>History of
Alexander</i>, etc., and the gorgeous <i>Life of Marie de
Medici</i>. If these notable examples were copied it is safe
to conclude that many others were.</p>

<p>The study of marks is left for another chapter, for, by
this time, even the enthusiast is wearying. There seems
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg&nbsp;198]</a></span>
so much to learn in this matter of investigating and identifying,
and, after all, everything is uncertain. One looks
about at identified pieces in museums and private collections,
even among the dealers, and the discouraging
thought comes that other people can tell at a glance. But
this is very far from being true.</p>

<p>Even the savant studies long and investigates much before
he gives a positive classification of a piece that is not
&ldquo;pedigreed.&rdquo; Here is a Flemish piece, here is a French,
he will declare, and for the life of you you cannot see
the ear-marks that tell the ancestry. And so in all humility
you ask, &ldquo;How can you tell with a glance of the eye?&rdquo;
But he does not. No one can do that in every case. He
must spend days at it, reflecting, reading, handling, if the
piece is evidently one of value. He will show you, perhaps,
as an honest dealer-collector showed me, a set of
five fine pieces which he could not identify at all. &ldquo;The
weave,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is Mortlake, the design in part German,
these are Italian <i>putti</i>&mdash;yet when all is told, I put down
the work as an Eighteenth Century copy of decadent
Renaissance. But I am far from sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If a dealer, surrounded by experienced helpers, can thus
be nonplussed, there is little cause for humiliation on the
part of the amateur who hesitates. It is not expected that
one can know at a glance whether a piece of work was
executed in France, or in Flanders at a given epoch. But
the more difficult the work of identification, the keener
the zest of the hunt. It is then that one calls into requisition
all the knowledge of art that the individual has been
unconsciously accumulating all the years of his life. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg&nbsp;199]</a></span>
applied arts reflect the art feeling of the age to which
they belong, and the diluted influence of the great artists
directs them. This is true of drawing and of colour.</p>

<p>History has ever its reflection on arts and crafts, but
perhaps it has in tapestry its most intentional record. It
is a forced and deliberate piece of egoism when a monarch
or a conqueror has a huge picture drawn exhibiting his
grandeur in battle or his elegance at home. In some
hangings modesty limits to the border of an imaginary
and decorative scene the monogram of the heroine of history
for whose apartments the tapestry was woven. And
so history is given a grace, a delicate meaning, a warm
interest, which is one of the side-gardens of delight that
show from the long path of identification study.</p>

<p>This little book has as its aim the gentle purpose of
pointing the way to a knowledge that shall be a guide
in knowing gold from&mdash;not from dross, that is too simple,
but gold from gold-plating let us say, for the mad lover
of tapestries will not admit that any hand-woven tapestry
is on the low level of dross. Any work which human
hands have touched and lingered on in execution is deserving
of the respect of the modern whose life must of necessity
be lived in hasty execution. Every chapter, then, is
but a caution or a counsel, and this one but a briefer statement
of the same matter. If onto the fringe of the main
thought hangs much of history, it is history inseparable
from it, for history of nations gives the history of great
men, and these regulate the doings of all the lesser ones
below them.</p>

<p>Identification, pure and simple, is for the rapt lover of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg&nbsp;200]</a></span>
art who pursues his game in museums and has his quiet
delights that others little dream of. But in general, to
the practical yet cultivated American, it is a means to
expend wisely the derided dollars that we impress upon
other nations to the artistic enrichment of our own country.</p>

<h2 class="padtop">CHAPTER XX</h2>

<h3>BORDERS</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>F the artists of tapestries had never drawn nor ever
woven anything but the borders that frame them, we
would have in that department alone sufficient matter
for happy investigation and acutely refined pleasure.
I even go so far as to think that in certain epochs the
border is the whole matter, and the main design is but
an enlargement of one of the many motives of which it
is composed. But that is in one particularly rich era, and
in good time we shall arrive at its joys.</p>

<p>First then&mdash;for the orderly mind grows stubborn and
confused at any beginning that begins in the middle&mdash;we
must hark back to the earliest tapestries. Tracing the
growth of the border is a pleasant pastime, a game of
history in which amorini, grotesques and nymphs are the
personages, and garlands of flowers their perpetual accessories,
but first comes the time when there were no borders,
the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>There were none, according to modern parlance, but it
was usual to edge each hanging with a tape of monotone,
a woven galloon of quiet hue, which had two purposes;
one, to finish neatly the work, as the housewife hems a
napkin; the other, to provide space of simple material
for hanging on rude hooks the big pictured surface.</p>

<p>This latter consideration was one of no small importance,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg&nbsp;202]</a></span>
as we can readily see by sending the thought back
to the time when tapestries led a very different life (so
human they seem in their association with men that the
expression must be allowed) from that of to-day, when
they are secured to stretchers, or lined, or even framed
behind glass like an easel painting.</p>

<p>In those other times of romance and chivalry a great
man&rsquo;s tapestries were always en route. Like their owner,
they were continually going on long marches, nor were
they allowed to rest long in one place. From the familiar
castle walls they were taken down to line the next habitat
of their owner, and that might be the castle of some other
lord, or it might be the tent of an encampment. Again,
it might be that an open-air exposition for a pageant, was
the temporary use.</p>

<p>The tapestries thus bundled about, forever hung and
unhung on hooks well or ill-spaced, handled roughly by
unknowing varlets or dull soldiers, these tapestries suffered
much, even to the point of dilapidation, and thus
arose the need for a tape border, and thus it happens also
that the relics of that time are found mainly among the
religious pieces. These last found safe asylum within
convent walls or in the sombre quiet of cathedral shades,
and like all who dwell within such precincts were protected
from contact with a rude world.</p>

<p>One day, sitting solitary at his wools, it occurred to the
weaver of the early Fifteenth Century to spill some of his
flowers out upon the dark galloon that edged his work.
The effect was charming. He experimented further,
went into the enchanted wood of such a design as that of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg&nbsp;203]</a></span>
<i>The Lady and the Unicorn</i> to pluck more flowers, and of
them wove a solid garland, symmetrical, strong, with
which to frame the picture. To keep from confounding
this with the airy bells and starry corollas of the tender
inspiring blossoms of the work, he made them bolder,
trained them to their service in solid symmetric mass, and
edged the whole, both sides, with the accustomed two-inch
line of solid rich maroon or blue.</p>

<p>It is easy to see the process of mind. For a long time
there had been gropings, the feeling that some sort of
border was needed, a division line between the world of
reality and the world of fable. Examine the Arras work
and see to what tricks the artist had recourse. The architectural
resource of columns, for example; where he could
do so, the artist decoyed one to the margin. Thus he
slipped in a frame, and broke none of the canons of his
art, and no more beautiful frame could have been devised,
as we see by following up the development and use
of the column. Once out from its position in the edge
of the picture into its post in the border, it never stops
in its beauty of growth until it reaches such perfection as
is seen in the twisted and garlanded columns which flank
the Rubens series, and those superb shafts in <i>The Royal
Residences</i> of Lebrun at the Gobelins under Louis XIV.</p>

<p>The other trick of framing in his subject which was
open to the Arras weaver whom we call Gothic, was to
set verses, long lines of print in French or Latin at top
or bottom.</p>

<p>But his first real legitimate border was made of the
same flowers and leaves that made graceful the finials and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg&nbsp;204]</a></span>
capitals of Gothic carving. Small clustered fruit, like
grapes or berries, came naturally mixed with these, as
Nature herself gives both fruit and flowers upon the earth
in one fair month.</p>

<p>Simplicity was the thing, and a continued turning to
Nature, not as to a cult like a latter-day nature-student,
but as a child to its mother, or a hart to the water brook.
As even in a border, stayed between two lines of solid-coloured
galloon, flowers and fruit do not stand forever
upright without help, the weaver gave probability to his
abundant mass by tying it here and there with a knot of
ribbon and letting the ribbon flaunt itself as ribbons have
ever done to the delight of the eye that loves a truant.</p>

<p>By this time&mdash;crawling over the top of the Fourteen
Hundreds&mdash;the border had grown wider, had left its
meagre allowance of three or four inches, and was fast
acquiring a foot in width. This meant more detail, a
broader design, coarser flowers, bigger fruit, and these
spraying over the galloon, and all but invading the picture.
It was all in the way of development. The simplicity
of former times was lost, but design was groping
for the great change, the change of the Renaissance.</p>

<p>The border tells quickly when it dawned, and when its
light put out all candles like a glorious sun&mdash;not forgetting
that some of those candles would better have been
left burning. By this time Brussels was the centre of
manufacture and the cartoonist had come to influence all
weavings. Just as carpenters and masons, who were the
planners and builders of our forefathers&rsquo; homes, have now
to submit to the domination of the <i>&Eacute;cole des Beaux Arts</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg&nbsp;205]</a></span>
graduates, so the man at the loom came under the direction
of Italian artists. And even the border was not left
to the mind of the weaver, but was carefully and consistently
planned by the artist to accompany his greater work,
if greater it was.</p>

<p>Raphael himself set that fashion. He was a born decorator,
and in laying out the borders of his tapestries
unbridled his wonderful invention and let it produce as
many harmonies as could be crowded into miniature. He
set the fashion of dividing the border into as many sections
as symmetry would allow, dividing them so daintily
that the eye scarce notes the division, so purely is it of the
intellect. In the border for the <i>Acts of the Apostles</i>, this
style of treatment is the one he preferred. This set has
no copy in America, but an almost unrivalled example
of this style of border is in the private collection of George
Blumenthal, Esq., the <i>Herse and Mercury</i>.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Here picture
follows picture in charming succession, in that purity
and perfection of design with which the early Renaissance
delights us. The classic note set by the subject of
the hanging is never forgotten, but on this key is played a
varied harmony of line and colour. For dainty invention,
this sort of border reaches a very high expression of art.</p>

<p>If Raphael set the fashion, others at least were not slow
in seizing the new idea and from that time on, until a
period much later&mdash;that of the Gobelins under Louis
XV&mdash;it was the fashion to introduce great and distracting
interest into the border. Even the little galloon became
a twist of two ribbons around a repeated flower, or a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg&nbsp;206]</a></span>
small reciprocal pattern, so covetous was design of all plain
spaces.</p>

<p>Lesser artists than Raphael also divided the border into
squares and oblongs, and with charming effect. The sides
were built up after the same fashion, but instead of the
delicate architectural divisions he affected, partitions were
made with massed fruit and flowers, vines and trellises.
The scenes were surprisingly dramatic, Flemish artists
showing a preference for such Biblical reminders as Samson
with his head being shorn in Delilah&rsquo;s lap, while
Philistines just beyond waited the enervating result of the
barber&rsquo;s work; or, any of the loves and conflicts of the
Greek myths was used.</p>

<p>The colouring&mdash;too much cannot be seen of the warm,
delicate blendings. There is always the look of a flowerbed
at dawn, before Chanticleer&rsquo;s second call has brought
the sun to sharpen outlines, before dreams and night-mist
have altogether quitted the place. Plenty of warm wood
colours are there, of lake blues, of smothered reds.
Precious they are to the eye, these scenes, but hard to find
now except in bits which some dealer has preserved by
framing in a screen or in the carved enclosure of some
nut-wood chair.</p>

<p>For a time borders continued thus, all marked off without
conscious effort, into countless delicious scenes. Then
a change begins. After perfection, must come something
less until the wave rises again. If in Raphael&rsquo;s time the
border claimed a two-foot strip for its imaginings, it was
slow in coming narrower again, and need required that
it be filled. But here is where the variance lay: Raphael
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg&nbsp;207]</a></span>
had so much to say that he begged space in which to portray
it; his imitators had so much space to fill that their
heavy imagination bungled clumsily in the effort. They
filled it, then, with a heterogeneous mass of foliage, fruit
and flowers, trained occasionally to make a bower for a
woman, a stand for a warrior, but all out of scale, never
keeping to any standard, and lost absolutely in unintelligent
confusion.</p>

<p>The Flemings in their decadence did this, and the
Italians in the Seventeenth Century did more, they introduced
all manner of cartouche. The cartouche plays an
important part in the boasting of great families and the
sycophancy of those who cater to men of high estate, for
it served as a field whereon to blazon the arms of the
patron, who doubtless felt as man has from all time, that
he must indeed be great whose symbols or initials are
permanently affixed to art or architecture. The cartouche
came to divide the border into medallions, to apportion
space for the various motives; but with a far less subtle
art than that of the older men who traced their airy
arbours and trailed their dainty vines and set their delicate
grotesques, in a manner half playful and wholly
charming.</p>

<p>But when the cartouche appeared, what is the effect?
It is as though a boxful of old brooches had been at hand
and these were set, symmetrically balanced, around the
frame, and the spaces between filled with miscellaneous
ornament on a scale of sumptuous size. Confusing, this,
and a far cry from harmony. Yet, such are the seductions
of tapestry in colour and texture, and so caressing is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg&nbsp;208]</a></span>
the hand of time, that these borders of the Seventeenth
Century given us by Italy and Flanders, are full of interest
and beauty.</p>

<p>The very bombast of them gives joy. Who can stand
before the Barberini set, <i>The Mysteries of the Life and
Death of Jesus Christ</i>, bequeathed to the Cathedral of St.
John, the Divine, in New York, by Mrs. Clarke, without
being more than pleased to recognise in the border the
indefatigable Barberini bee? We are human enough to
glance at the pictures of sacred scenes as on a tale that is
told, but that potent insect makes us at once acquainted
with a family of renown, puts us on a friendly footing
with a great cardinal of the house, reminds us of sundry
wanderings of our own in Rome; and then, suddenly
flashes from its wings a memory of the great conqueror
of Europe, who after the Italian campaign, set this bee
among his own personal symbols and called it Napoleonic.
Yes, these things interest us enormously, personally,
for they pique imagination and help memory
to fit together neatly the wandering bits of history&rsquo;s jigsaw
puzzle. Besides this, they help the work of identifying
old tapestries, a pleasure so keen that every sense
is enlivened thereby.</p>

<p>When decorative design deserts the Greek example, it
strays on dangerous ground, unless Nature is the model.
The Italians of the Seventeenth Century, tired of forever
imitating and copying, lost all their refinement in the
effort to originate. Grossness, sensuality took the place
of fine purity in border designs. Inflation, so to speak,
replaced inspiration.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg&nbsp;209]</a></span>
Amorini&mdash;the word can hardly be used without suggesting
the gay babes who tumble deliciously among
Correggio&rsquo;s clouds or who snatch flowers in ways of grace,
on every sort of decoration. In these later drawings,
these tapestry borders of say 1650, they are monsters of
distortion, and resemble not at all the rosy child we know
in the flesh. They are overfed, self-indulgent, steeped
in the wisdom of a corrupt and licentious experience. I
cannot feel that anyone should like them, except as curiosities
of a past century.</p>

<p>Heavy swags of fruit, searching for larger things,
changed to pumpkins, melons, in the gross fashion of enlarged
designs for borders. Almost they fell of their own
weight. Cornucopias spilled out, each one, the harvest
of an acre. And thus paucity of imagination was replaced
by increase in the size of each object used in filling up
the border&rsquo;s allotted space.</p>

<p>After this riot had continued long enough in its inebriety,
the corrective came through the influence of Rubens
in the North and of Lebrun in France. These two
geniuses knew how to gather into their control the art
strength of their age, and to train it into intellectual results.
Mere bulk, mere space-filling, had to give way
under the mind force of these two men, who by their
superb invention gave new standards to decorative art in
Flanders and in France. Drawings were made in scale
again, and designs were built in harmony, constructed not
merely to catch the eye, but to gratify the logical mind.</p>

<p>The day was for the grandiose in borders. The petite
and <i>mignonne</i> of Raphael&rsquo;s grotesques was no longer
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg&nbsp;210]</a></span>
suited to the people, or, to put it otherwise, the people
were not such as seek expression in refinement, for all art
is but the visible evidence of a state of mind or soul.</p>

<p>The wish to be sumptuous and superb, then, was a force,
and so the art expressed it, but in a way that holds our admiration.
A stroll in the Metropolitan Museum of Art,
New York, shows us better than words the perfection of
design at this grandiose era. There one sees <i>Antony and
Cleopatra</i> of Rubens&mdash;probably. On these hangings the
border has all the evidences of genius. If there were no
picture at all to enclose, if there were but this decorative
frame, a superb inspiration would be flaunted. From
substantial urns at right and left, springs the design at
the sides which mounts higher and higher, design on design,
but always with probability. That is the secret of
its beauty, its probability, yet we are cheated all the time
and like it. No vase of fruit could ever uphold a cupid&rsquo;s
frolic, nor could an emblematic bird support a chalice,
yet the artist makes it seem so. Note how he hangs his
swags, and swings his amorini, from the horizontal borders.
He first sets a good strong architectural moulding
of classic egg-and-dart, and leaf, and into this able motive
thrusts hooks and rings. From these solid facts he hangs
his happy weight of fruit and flower and peachy flesh.
Nothing could be more simple, nothing could be more
logical. The cartouche at the top, he had no choice
but to put it there, to hold the title of the picture, and at
the bottom came a tiny landscape to balance. So much
for fashion well executed.</p>

<p>Colours were reformed, too, at this time, for we are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg&nbsp;211]</a></span>
now at the era when tapestry had its last run of best days,
that is to say, at the time when France began her wondrous
ascendency under Louis XIV. In Italy colours had grown
garish. Too much light in that country of the sun, flooded
and over-coloured its pictured scenes. Tints were too
strong, masses of blue and yellow and red glared all in
tones purely bright. They may have suited the twilight
of the church, the gloom of a palace closed in narrow
streets, but they scourge the modern eye as does a blasting
light. The Gothic days gave borders the deep soft tones
of serious mood; the Renaissance played on a daintier
scale; the Seventeenth Century rushed into too frank a
palette.</p>

<p>It remained for Rubens and Lebrun to find a scheme
both rich and subdued, to bring back the taste errant.
Here let me note a peculiarity of colour, noticeable in
work of Seventeenth and Eighteenth Century borders.
The colour tone varies in different pieces of the same set,
and this is not the result of fading, but was done by deliberate
intent, one side border being light and another dark,
or one entire border being lighter than others of the same
set.</p>

<p>Lest in speaking of borders, too much reference might
be made to the history of tapestry in general, I have left
out Simon Vouet and Henri Lerambert as inspired composers
of the frame which enclosed their cartoons; but it
is well to say briefly that these men at least had not followed
false gods, and were not guilty of the flagrant
offence to taste that put a smirch on Italian art. These
are the men who preceded the establishment of State
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg&nbsp;212]</a></span>
ateliers under Louis XIV and who made productive the
reign of Henri IV.</p>

<p>If Rubens kept to a style of large detail, that was a popular
one and had many followers in a grandiose age. Lebrun
in borders harked back to the classics of Greece and
Rome, thus restoring the exquisite quality of delicacy associated
with a thousand designs of amphor&aelig;, foliated
scrolls and light grotesques. But he expressed himself
more individually and daringly in the series called <i>The
Months</i> and <i>The Royal Residences</i>. This set is so celebrated,
so delectable, so grateful to the eye of the tapestry
lover, that familiarity with it must be assumed. You recollect
it, once you have seen no more than a photograph
of one of its squares. But it cannot be pertinent here, for
it has no important border, say you. No, rather it is all
border. Look what the cunning artist has done. His
problem was to picture twelve country houses. To his
mind it must have seemed like converting a room into an
architect&rsquo;s office, to hang it full of buildings. But genius
came to the front, his wonderful feeling for decoration,
and lo, he filled his canvas with glorious foreground, full
of things man lives with; columns, the size appropriate to
the salon they are placed in; urns, peacocks, all the ante-terrace
frippery of the grand age, arranged in the foreground.
Garlands are fresh hung on the columns as
though our decorator had but just posed them, and beyond
are clustered trees&mdash;with a small opening for a vista.
Way off in the light-bathed distance stands the faithfully
drawn ch&acirc;teau, but here, here where the observer stands,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg&nbsp;213]</a></span>
is all elegance and grace and welcome shade, and close
friendship with luxury.</p>

<p>This work of Lebrun&rsquo;s is then the epitome of border.
Greater than this hath no man done, to make a tapestry
all border which yet so intensified the value of the small
central design, that not even the royal patron, jealous of
his own conspicuousness, discovered that art had replaced
display.</p>

<p>After that a great change came. As the picture ever
regulates the border, that change was but logical. After
the &ldquo;Sun King&rdquo; came the regency of the effeminate
Philippe, whom the Queen Mother had kept more like a
court page than a man. Artists lapped over from the
previous reign, and these were encouraged to develop the
smaller, daintier, more effeminate designs that had already
begun to assert their charm. Borders took on the new
method. And as small space was needed for the curves
and shells and latticed bands, the border narrower grew.</p>

<p>Like Alice, after the potent dose, the border shrank and
shrank, until in time it became a gold frame, like the <i>encadrement</i>
of any easel picture. And that, too, was logical,
for tapestries became at this time like painted
pictures, and lost their original significance of undulating
hangings.</p>

<p>The well-known motives of the Louis XV decoration
rippled around the edge of the tapestry, woven in shades
of yellow silk and imitated well the carved and gilded
wood of other frames, those of chairs and screens and
paintings. There are those who deplore the mode, but
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg&nbsp;214]</a></span>
at least it seems appropriate to the style of picture it
encloses.</p>

<p>And here let us consider a moment this matter of appropriateness.
So far we have thought only of tapestries and
their borders as inseparable, and as composed at the same
time. But, alas, this is the ideal; the fact is that in the
habit which weavers had of repeating their sets when
a model proved a favourite among patrons, led them into
providing variety by setting up a different border around
the drawing. As this reproducing, this copying of old
cartoons was sometimes done one or two hundred years
after the original was drawn, we find an anachronism most
disagreeable to one who has an orderly mind, who hates
to see a telephone in a Venus&rsquo; shell, for instance. The
whole thing is thrown out of key. It is as though your
old family portrait of the Colonial Governor was framed
in &ldquo;art nouveau.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The big men, the almost divine Raphael, and later
Rubens, felt so keenly the necessity of harmony between
picture and frame, that they were not above drawing their
own borders, and it is evident they delighted in the work.
But Raphael&rsquo;s cartoons went not only to Brussels, but
elsewhere, and somehow the borders got left behind; and
thus we see his celebrated suite of <i>Acts of the Apostles</i>
with a different entourage in the Madrid set from what
it bears in Rome.</p>

<p>There is another matter, and this has to do with commerce
more than art. An old tapestry is of such value
that mere association with it adds to the market price of
newer work. So it is that sometimes a whole border is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg&nbsp;215]</a></span>
cut off and transferred to an inferior tapestry, and the
tapestry thus denuded is surrounded with a border woven
nowadays in some atelier of repairs, copied from an old
design.</p>

<p>Let such desecrators beware. The border of a tapestry
must appertain, must be an integral part of the whole
design for the sake of artistic harmony.</p>

<h3>TAPESTRY MARKS</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">R</span>EGARDLESS of what a man&rsquo;s longing for fame
may have been in the Middle Ages, he let his
works pass into the world without a sign upon
them that portrayed their author. This is as true of the
lesser arts as of the greater. It was not the fashion in
the days of Giotto, nor of Raphael, to sign a painting in
vermillion with a flourished underscore. The artist was
content to sink individuality in the general good, to work
for art&rsquo;s sake, not for personal fame.</p>

<p>This was true of the lesser artists who wove or directed
the weaving of the tapestries called Gothic, not only
through the time of the simple earnest primitives, but
through the brilliant high development of that style as
shown at the studio of Jean de Rome, of the Brussels
ateliers, through the years lying between the close of the
Fifteenth Century and the Raphael invasion.</p>

<p>Even that important event brought no consequence of
that sort. The freemasonry among celebrities in those
days showed its perfection by this very lack of signed
work. Everybody knew the man by his works, and the
works by their excellence.</p>

<p>Tapestry marks were non-existent as a system until the
Brussels edict of 1528 made them compulsory in that
town. Documents and history have been less unkind to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg&nbsp;217]</a></span>
those early workers, and to those of us who like to feel the
thrill of human brotherhood as it connects the artist and
craftsman centuries dead with our own strife for the ideal.
Nicolas Bataille in 1379 cannot remain unknown since the
publishing of certain documents concerning his Christmas
task of the <i>Apocalypse</i>, and there are scores of known
master weavers reaching up through the ages to the time
when marks began.</p>

<p>The Brussels mark was the first. It was a simple and
appropriate composition, a shield flanked with two letters
B. These were capitals or not. One was reversed or
not, with little arbitrariness, for the mark was legible and
unmistakable in any case, even though the weaver took
great liberties&mdash;as he sometimes did. The place for this
mark was the galloon, and it was usually executed in a
lighter colour, but a single tone.</p>

<p>So much for the town mark, which has a score or more
of variations. In addition to this was the mark of the
weaver or of the merchant who gave the commission. A
pity it was thus to confound the two, to give such confusion
between a gifted craftsman and a mere dealer. One was
giving the years of his life and the cunning of his hand
to the work, while the other did but please a rich or royal
patron with his wares. But so it was, and we can but
study over the symbols and glean at least that the tapestry
was considered a worthy one, reached the high standard
of the day, or it would have had no mark at all.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg&nbsp;218]</a></span>
For it was thus that the marks were first adopted. They
were for the protection of every one against fraud. High
perfection made Brussels famous, but fame brought with
it such a rush of patronage that only by lessening the
quality of productions could orders be filled in such hot
haste.</p>

<p>Tricks of the trade grew and prospered; there were
tricks of dyeing after a tapestry was finished, in case the
flesh tints or other light shades were not pleasing. There
was a trick of dividing a large square into strips so that
several looms might work upon it at once. And there
was all manner of slighting in the weave, in the use of
the comb which makes close the fabric, in the setting of
the warp to make a less than usual number of threads to
the inch. In fact, men tricked men as much in those days
as in our own.</p>

<p>The fame of the city&rsquo;s industry was in danger. It was
the province of the guild of tapestry-makers to protect
it against its own evils. Thus, in 1528, a few years after
the weaving of the Raphael tapestries, the law was made
that all tapestries should bear the Brussels mark and that
of the weaver or the client. Small tapestries were exempt,
but at that time small tapestries were not frequent,
or were simple verdures, and, charming as they are, they
lacked the same intellectual effort of composition.</p>

<p>The Brussels guild stipulated the size at which the
tapestry should be marked. It was given at six ells, a
Flemish ell being about 27&frac12; inches. Therefore, a tapestry
under approximately thirteen feet might escape the
order. But that was the day of large tapestries, the day
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg&nbsp;219]</a></span>
of the Italian cartoonists, and important pieces reached
that measure.</p>

<p>The guild of the tapissiers in Brussels, once started on
restrictions, drew article after article, until it seemed that
manacles were put on the masters&rsquo; hands. To these restrictions
the decadence of Brussels is ascribed, but that
were like laying a criminal&rsquo;s fault to the laws of the country.
Primarily must have been the desire to shirk, the
intent to do questionable work. And behind that must
have been a basic cause. Possibly it was one of those
which we are apt to consider modern, that is, the desire
to turn effort into the coin of the realm. All of the enormous
quantity of orders received by Brussels in the days
of her highest prosperity could not have been accepted
had not the master of the ateliers pressed his underlings
to highest speed.</p>

<p>Speed meant deterioration in quality of work, and so
Brussels tried by laws to prevent this lamentable result,
and to protect the fair fame of the symbol woven in the
bordering galloon. The other sign which accompanied
the town mark, of the two letters B, should have had excellent
results, the personal mark of the weaver that his work
might be known.</p>

<p>In spite of this spur to personal pride, the standard
lessened in a few years, but not until certain weavers had
won a fame that thrills even at this distance. Unfortunately,
a great client was considered as important as a
weaver, and it was often his arbitrary sign that was woven.
And sometimes a dealer, wishing glory through his dealings,
ordered his sign in the galloon. And thus comes a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg&nbsp;220]</a></span>
long array of signs which are not identifiable always. In
general, one or two initials were introduced into these
symbols, which were fanciful designs that any idle pencil
might draw, but in the lapse of years it is not possible to
know which able weaver or what great purveyor to royalty
the letter A or B or C may have signified.</p>

<p>Happily the light of Wilhelm de Pannemaker could not
be hid even by piling centuries upon it. His works were
of such a nature that, like those of Van Aelst, who had no
mark, they would always be known for their historic association.
In illustration, there is his set of the <i>Conquest
of Tunis</i> (plate facing page <a href="#CONQUEST_OF_TUNIS"><b>62</b></a>), woven under circumstances
of interest. Even without a mark, it would still be
known that the master weaver of Brussels (whom all acknowledged
Pannemaker to be) set up his looms, so many
that it must have seemed to the folk of Granada that a new
industry had come to live among them. And it is a matter
of Spanish history that the great Emperor Charles V
carried in his train the court artist, Van Orley, that his
exploits be pictured for the gratification of himself and
posterity.</p>

<p>But Wilhelm de Pannemaker lived and worked in the
time of marks, so his tapestries bear his sign in addition
to the Brussels mark. Of symbols he had as many as
nine or ten, but all of the same general character, taking
as their main motive the W and the P of his name.</p>

<p>Incorporated into his sign, as into many others of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg&nbsp;221]</a></span>
period, was a mark resembling a figure 4. Tradition has
it that when this four was reversed, the tapestry was not
for a private client, but for a dealer. One set of the <i>Vertumnus
and Pomona</i> at Madrid (plates facing pages <a href="#VERTUMNUS_AND_POMONA01"><b>72</b></a>,
<a href="#VERTUMNUS_AND_POMONA02"><b>73</b></a>, <a href="#VERTUMNUS_AND_POMONA03"><b>74</b></a>,
<a href="#VERTUMNUS_AND_POMONA04"><b>75</b></a>) bears De Pannemaker&rsquo;s mark, while others
have a conglomerate pencilling.</p>

<p>The sign of Jacques Geubels is, like W. de Pannemaker&rsquo;s,
made up of his initials combined with fantastic
lines which doubtless were full of meaning to their inventor,
little as they convey to us. The example of
Jacques Geubels&rsquo; weaving given in the <a href="#BRUSSELS_TAPESTRY"><b>plate</b></a> is from the
Chicago Institute of Art. His time was late Sixteenth
Century.</p>

<p>The <i>Acts of the Apostles</i> of Raphael, the first set, was
woven by Peter van Aelst without a mark, but the set
at Madrid bears the marks of several Brussels weavers,
some attributed to Nicolas Leyniers.</p>

<p>The desirability of distinguishing tapestries by marks
in the galloon appealed to other weaving centres, and the
method of Brussels found favour outside that town. Presently
Bruges adopted a sign similar to that of her neighbour,
by adding to the double B and shield a small b
traversed by a crown.</p>

<p>Enghien is one of the tapestry towns of which we are
gradually becoming aware. Its products have not always
been recognised, but of late more interest is taken in this
tributary to the great stream of the Sixteenth and Seventeenth
Centuries.</p>

<p>The famous Peter or Pierre van Aelst, selected from
all of Flanders&rsquo; able craftsmen to work for Raphael and
the Pope, was born in this little town, wove here and,
more yet, was known as Pierre of Enghien. Yet it is the
larger town of Brussels which wore his laurels.</p>

<p>The Enghien town marks are an easy adaptation of the
arms of the place, and the weavers&rsquo; marks are generally
monograms.</p>

<p>Weavers&rsquo; marks, after playing about the eccentricities
of cipher, changed in the Seventeenth Century to easily
read initials, sometimes interlaced, sometimes apart.
Later on it became the mode to weave the entire name.
An example of these is the two letters C of Charles de
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg&nbsp;223]</a></span>
Comans on the galloon of <i>Meleager and Atalanta</i> (plate
facing page <a href="#MELEAGER_AND_ATALANTA"><b>68</b></a>); and the name G. V. D. Strecken in the
<i>Antony and Cleopatra</i> (plate facing page <a href="#MEETING_OF_ANTONY_AND_CLEOPATRA"><b>79</b></a>).</p>

<p>Other countries than Flanders were wise in their generation,
and placed the marks that are so welcome to the
eye of the modern who seeks to know all the secrets of
the tapestry before him. In the Seventeenth Century,
when Paris was gathering her scattered decorative force
for later demonstration at the Gobelins, the city had a
pretty mark for its own, a simple fleur-de-lis and the initial
P, and the initials of the weaver.</p>

of the <i>History of the King</i>. (Plate facing page
<a href="#LOUIS_XIV_VISITING"><b>114</b></a>.) It was a simple monogram or union of his initials.
In the Eighteenth Century the Gobelins took the fleur-de-lis
of Paris, and its own initial letter G. The modern
Gobelins&rsquo; marks combined the G with an implement of
the craft, a <i>broche</i> and a straying thread.</p>

<p>When the Mortlake factory was established in England,
the date was sufficiently late, 1619, for marking to
be considered a necessity. The factory mark was a simple
shield quartered by means of a cross thrown thereon.

Sir Francis Crane contented himself with a simple F. C.,
one a-top the other, as his identification. Philip de
Maecht, he whose family went from Holland to England
as tapissiers, directed at Mortlake the weaving of a part
of the celebrated <i>Vulcan</i> and <i>Venus</i> series, and his monogram
can be seen on <i>The Expulsion of Vulcan from
Olympus</i> (coloured plate facing page <a href="#EXPULSION_OF_VULCAN"><b>170</b></a>), owned by
Mrs. A. von Zedlitz, as well as in the other rare <i>Vulcan</i>

Maecht worked under De Comans in Paris, he having

<p>The marks on tapestries are as numerous as the marks
on china or silver, and the absence of marks confronts
the hunter of signs with baffling blankness, as is the case
of many very old wares, whether china, silver or tapestries.
Also, late work of poor quality is unmarked.
Having thus disposed of the situation, it remains to identify
the marks when they exist. The exhaustive works
of the French writers must be consulted for this pleasure.
There are hundreds of known signs, but there exist also
many unidentified signs, yet the presence of a sign of any
kind is a keen joy to the owner of a hanging which displays
it.</p>

<h2 class="padtop">CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<h3>HOW IT IS MADE</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>ANTING to see the wheels go &rsquo;round is a
desire not limited to babes. We, with our
minds stocked with the history and romance
of tapestry, yet want to know just how it is made in every
particular, just how the loom works, how the threads are
placed.</p>

<p>It seems that there must be some obscure and occult
secret hidden within the looms that work such magic, and
we want to pluck it out, lay it in the sunlight and dissect
its intricacies. Well, then, let us enter a tapestry factory
and see what is there. But it is safe to forecast the final
deduction&mdash;which must ever be that the god of patience
is here omnipotent. Talent there must be, but even that
is without avail if patience lacks.</p>

<p>The factory for tapestries seems, then, little like a factory.
The belt and wheel, the throb and haste are not
there. The whole place seems like a quiet school, where
tasks are done in silence broken by an occasional voice or
two. It is a place where every one seems bent on accomplishing
a brave amount of fancy-work; a kindergarten,
if you like, for grown-ups.</p>

<p>Within are many departments of labour. The looms
are the thing, of course, so must be considered first,
although much preparing is done before their work can
be begun.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg&nbsp;227]</a></span>
The looms are classic in their method, in their simplicity.
They have scarcely changed since the days when
Solomon built his Temple and draped it with such gorgeous
hangings that even the inspired writers digress to
emphasise their richness with long descriptions that could
not possibly have assisted the cause of their religion.</p>

<p>The stitch made by the modern loom is the same as that
made by the looms of the furthermost-back Egyptian, by
the Greeks, by the Chinese, of primitive peoples everywhere,
by the people of the East in the familiar Khelim
rugs, and by the aborigines of the two Americas. There
is nothing new, nothing obscure about it, being a simple
weaving of warp and woof. Penelope&rsquo;s loom was the
same almost as that in use to-day at the Gobelins factory
in Paris. Archeologists have discovered pictures of the
ancient Egyptian loom, and of Penelope&rsquo;s, and there is
but little change from the times of these ladies to our days.</p>

<p>The fact is, the work is hand-work, must always be so,
and the loom is but a tool for its working, a tool which
keeps in place the threads set by hand. That is why tapestry
must always be valuable and original and no more
possible to copy by machine than is a painting.</p>

<p>High warp and low warp are the terms so often used
as to seem a shibboleth. <i>Haute lisse</i> and <i>basse lisse</i> are
their French equivalents. They describe the two kinds
of looms, the former signifying the loom which stands
upright, or high; the latter indicating the loom which
is extended horizontally or low. On the high loom, the
instrument which holds the thread is called the <i>broche</i>,
and on the low loom it is called the <i>flute</i>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg&nbsp;228]</a></span>
The stitch produced by the two is the same. The manner
of producing it varies in convenience to the operators,
the low-warp being the easier, or at least the more convenient
and therefore the quicker method.</p>

<p>The cynic is ever ready to say that the tyrant living
within a man declares only for those things which represent
great sacrifice of time and effort on the part of other
men. Perhaps it is true, and that therein lies the preference
of the connoisseur in tapestry for the works of the
high-warp loom. Even the wisest experts cannot always
tell by an examination of a fabric, on which sort of loom
it was woven, high warp or low, other evidence being
excluded.</p>

<p>The high loom has, then, the threads of its warp hung
like a weighted veil, from the top of the loom to the floor,
with a huge wooden roller to receive the finished fabric
at the bottom and one at the top for the yet unneeded
threads. Each thread of the warp is caught by a loop,
which in turn is fastened to a movable bar, and by means
of this the worker is able to advance or withdraw the
alternate threads for the casting of the <i>broche</i> or <i>flute</i>,
which is the shuttle. Behind the veil of the warp sits the
weaver&mdash;<i>tissier</i> or <i>tapissier</i>&mdash;with his supply of coloured
thread; back of him is the cartoon he is copying. He
can only see his work by means of a little mirror the other
side of his warp, which reflects it. The only indulgence
that convenience accords him is a tracing on the white
threads of the warp, a copy of the picture he is weaving.
Thus stands the prisoner of art, sentenced to hard labour,

<p class="caption">SEWING AND REPAIR DEPARTMENT. BAUMGARTEN ATELIERS</p>

<p>High-warp looms were those that made famous the
tapestries of Arras in the Fifteenth Century, of Brussels
in the Sixteenth, and of Paris in the Seventeenth, therefore
it is not strange that they are worshipped as having
a resident, mysterious power.</p>

<p>To-day, the age of practicality, they scarcely exist outside
the old Gobelins in Paris. But this is not the day
of tapestry weaving.</p>

<p>A shuttle, thrown by machine, goes all the width of the
fabric, back and forth. The <i>flute</i> or <i>broche</i>, which is the
shuttle of the tapestry weaver, flies only as far as it is desired
to thrust it, to finish the figure on which its especial
colour is required. Thus, a leaf, a detail of any small
sort, may mount higher and higher on the warp, to its
completion, before other adjacent parts are attempted.</p>

<p>The effect of this is to leave open slits, petty gashes in
the fabric, running lengthwise of the warp, and these are
all united later with the needle, in the hands of the women
who thus finish the pieces.</p>

<p>Unused colours wound on the hundreds of flutes are
dropped at the demand of the pattern, left in a rich confusion
of shades to be resumed by the workmen at will;
but the threads are not severed, if the colour is to be used
again soon.</p>

<p>Low-warp work is the same except for the weaver&rsquo;s position
in relation to his work. Instead of the warp like a
thin wall before his face, on which he seems to play as on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg&nbsp;230]</a></span>
one side of a harp, the warp is extended before him as a
table. It is easy to see how much more convenient is this
method.</p>

<p>The wooden rollers are the same, one for the yet unused
length of warp, the other for the finished fabric, and over
one of these rollers the worker leans, protected from its
hostile hardness by a pillow.</p>

<p>The pattern lies below, just beneath the warp, and easily
seen through it, not the mere tracing as on the threads of
the high-warp loom, but the coloured cartoon, so that
shades may be followed as well as lines. It sometimes
happens, however, in copying a valuable old tapestry, that
a black and white drawing only is placed under the warp
while the original is suspended behind the weavers, who
look to it for colour suggestion.</p>

<p>In low-warp the worker has the privilege of laying his
flutes on top the work, the flutes not at the moment in
use, and there they lie in convenient mass ready to resume
for the figure abandoned for another. If the right hand
thrusts the flute, it is the duty of the left to see that
the alternate and the limiting threads of the warp are
properly lifted. First comes a pressure of the foot on
a long, lath-like pedal which is attached to the bar
holding in turn the loops which pass around alternate
threads.</p>

<p>That pressure lifts the threads, and the fingers of the
left hand, deft and agile, limit and select those which the
flute shall cover with its coloured woof.</p>

<p>After the casting of a thread, or of a group of threads,
the weaver picks up a comb of steel or of ivory, and packs
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg&nbsp;231]</a></span>
hard the woof, one line against another, to make the fabric
firm and even in the weaving.</p>

<p>Such then is the simple process of the looms, far simpler
seen than described and yet depending absolutely for
its beauty on the talent and patience of gifted workers.
It is as simple as the alphabet, yet as complicated as the
dictionary.</p>

<p>Patient years of apprenticeship must a man spend before
he can become a good weaver, and then must he give
the best years of his life to becoming perfect in the craft.
But if the work is exacting, at least it is agreeable, almost
lovable, and in delightful contrast to the labour of those
who but tend machines driven by power. And if the art
of tapestry weaving is almost a lost one to-day, at least
the weavers can find in history much matter for pride.
It is no mean ambition to follow the profession of conscientious
Nicolas Bataille, of the able Pannemaker, of La
Planche and Comans, of Tessier, Cozette, and a hundred
others of family and fame.</p>

<p>Much preparation is necessary before the loom can be
set going. First is the design, the cartoon. There we
are in the department of the artist, and must talk in whispers.
Raphael belongs there, and Leonardo; and Rubens,
Teniers, Lebrun, Boucher and David, train us through
the past centuries into our own.</p>

<p>But the cartoon of to-day is not so sacred a matter, and
we may speak of it frankly&mdash;regretfully, too. Cartoons
hang all over the walls of the tapestry factory, so much
property for the setting of future scenes, and besides, they
make a decoration which alone would lift the tapestry
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg&nbsp;232]</a></span>
factory into the regions of art and class it among ateliers,
instead of factories. The cartoons are painted, however,
where the artist will, in his own studio or in one provided
for the purpose by the director, as in the case of the Baumgarten
works. They have the look of special designs.
They are not done in the manner of a painting to be hung
on a wall. Their brushwork is smooth and broad, dividing
lines well distinguished by marked contrasts in colour
to make possible their translation into the language of
silk and wool.</p>

<p>After the cartoon is ready, comes the warp. That is
set with the closeness agreed upon. Naturally, the smaller
the thread of the warp, the closer is it set, the more threads
to the inch, and thus comes fine fabric. Coarser warp
means fewer threads to the inch, quicker work for the
weaver and less value to the tapestry. From ten to twenty
threads to the inch carries the limits of coarseness and
fineness. In fine weaving, a weaver will accomplish but
a square foot a week. Think of that, you who wonder at
the price of tapestries ordered for the new drawing-room.</p>

<p>The warp comes to the factory all in big hanks of even
thread. Nowadays it is usually of cotton, although they
contend at the Gobelins that wool warp is preferable, for
it gives the finished fabric a lightness and flexibility that
the heavier, stiffer cotton destroys.</p>

<p>Setting the warp is a matter of patience and precision,
and we will leave the workman with it, to make it the
whole length of the tapestry to be woven, and to fasten the
loops of thread around each <i>cha&icirc;ne</i> and to fasten those in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg&nbsp;233]</a></span>
turn, alternating, to the bar by means of which they may be
shifted to make the in-and-out of the weaving.</p>

<p>Then after choosing the colours, the weaving begins.
It is like nothing so much as a piece of fancy-work. If
it were not for the cumbersome loom, I am sure ladies
would emulate the king who wove for amusement, and
would make chair-pieces on the summer veranda.</p>

<p>But before the silks and wools go to the weaving they
are treated to a beauty-bath in the dye-room. Hanks of
wool and skeins of silk are but neutral matters, coming to
the factory devoid of individuality, mere pale, soft bulk.</p>

<p>A room apart, somewhere away from the studio of design
and the rooms where the looms stand stolid, is a
laboratory of dyes, a place which looks like a farmhouse
kitchen on preserving day. You sniff the air as you go
in, the air that is swaying long bunches of pendulous
colour, and it smells warm and moist and full of the suggestions
of magic.</p>

<p>Over a big cauldron two men are bending, stirring a
witches&rsquo; broth to charm man&rsquo;s eye. One of the wooden
paddles brings up a mass from the heavy liquid. It is
silk, glistening rich, of the colour of melted rubies. Upstairs
the looms are making it into a damask background
onto which are thrown the garlands Boucher drew and
Tessier loved to work.</p>

<p>Dainties fished up from another cauldron are strung
along a line to dry, soft wool and shining silk, all in shades
of grapes, of asters, of heliotropes, telling their manifest
destiny. And beyond, are great bunches of colour, red
which mounts a quivering scale to salmon pink, blue
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg&nbsp;234]</a></span>
which sails into tempered gray, greens dancing to the note
of the forest. It is a nature&rsquo;s workshop, a laboratory
where the rainbow serves, apprenticed.</p>

<p>Jars, stone jars, little kegs, all ugly enough, are standing
against the wall. But uncover one, touch the thick
dark stuff within, and feast your eye on the colour left on
a curious finger-tip. You are close to the cochineal, to
indigo, and all the wonderful alchemy of colour.</p>

<p>Aniline? Not a bit of the treacherous stuff. It takes
the eye, but it is a fickle friend. They say a mordant
has been found to stay the flight of its lovely colours.
Perhaps; it may be. But what weaver of tapestry would
be willing to confide his labour to the care of a dye that
has not known the test of ages? Aniline dye, says the
director of a tapestry factory, may last twenty years&mdash;but
twenty years is nothing in the life of a tapestry. Over
in Paris, at the Gobelins, a master rules as chemist of the
dyes, with the dignity of a special laboratory for making
them.</p>

<p>In America, with no government assuming the expense,
the dyes are bought in such form that only expert
dyers can use them in the few factories which exist.
But no new hazards are taken. The matter is too serious.
Economy in dyes brings too great disaster to contemplate.
It is only too true that a man, several men, may labour a
year to produce a perfect work, and that all the labour
may be ruined by an ephemeral dye, by the escape of tones
skilfully laid. Let commerce cheat in some other way, if
it must, but not in this. Let the dye be honest, as enduring
as the colours imprisoned in gems.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg&nbsp;235]</a></span>
It is a modern economy. The ancients knew not of
it, and were willing to spend any amount on colours.
More than that a port, or a nation, was willing to rest
its fame on a single colour. Purple of Tyre, red of
Turkey, yellow of China, are terms familiar through the
ages, and think not these colours were to be had for the
asking. They brought prices which we do not pay now
even in this age of money. The brothers Gobelins&mdash;their
fame originally rested on their ambition to be &ldquo;dyers of
scarlet,&rdquo; that being an ultimate test of skill.</p>

<p>It is a serious matter, that of dyeing wools and silks
for tapestries, and one which the directors conduct within
the walls of the tapestry factory. The Gobelins uses for
its reds, cochineal or the roots of the madder; for blue,
indigo and Prussian blue; for yellow, the vegetable colour
extracted from gaude.</p>

<p>In America there is a specialist in dyes: Miss Charlotte
Pendleton, who gives her entire attention to rediscovering
the dyes of the ancients, the dyes that made a
city&rsquo;s fame. It is owing to her conscientious work that the
tapestry repairers of museums can find appropriate
threads.</p>

<p>It is interesting to trace the differing gamut of colour
through the ages. Old dyes produced, old weavers
needed, but twenty tones for the old work. Tapestries of
the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Centuries were as simple in
scale as stained glass, and as honest. Flesh tints were neutral
by contrast to the splendid reds, honest yellows and
rich greens. Colours meant something, then, too; had a
sentimental language all their own. When white
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg&nbsp;236]</a></span>
predominated, purity was implied; black was mortification
of the flesh; livid yellow was tribulation; red, charity;
green, meditation.</p>

<p>An examination of the colours in the series which depicts
the life of Louis XIV, reveals a use of but seventy-nine
colours. So up to that time, great honesty of dye,
and fine decorative effect were preserved. The shades
were produced by two little tricks open as the day, hatching
being one, the other, winding two shades on the same
broche or shuttle. Hatching, as we know, is merely a
penman&rsquo;s trick, of shading with lines of light and dark.</p>

<p>It was when they began to paint the lily, in the days of
pretty corruption, that the whole matter of dyeing
changed. In the Eighteenth Century when the Regent
Philip, and then La Pompadour, set the mode, things
greatly altered. When big decorative effects were no
more, the stimulating effect of deep strong colour was
considered vulgar, and, only the suave sweetness of
Boucher, Nattier, Fragonard, were admired. Every one
played a pretty part, all life was a theatre of gay comedy,
or a flattered miniature.</p>

<p>So, as we have seen, new times and new modes caused
the Gobelins to copy paintings instead of to interpret cartoons&mdash;and
there lay the destruction of their art. Instead
of four-score tones, the dyers hung on their lines tens and
tens of thousands. And the weavers wove them all into
their fabric-painting, with the result that when the light
lay on them long, the delicate shades faded and with them
was lost the meaning of the design. And that is why the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg&nbsp;237]</a></span>
Gobelins of the older time are worth more as decoration
than those of the later.</p>

<p>We are doing a little better nowadays. There is a limit
to the tones, and in all new work a decided tendency to
abandon the copying of brush-shading in favour of a
more restricted gamut of colour. By this means the future
worker may regain the lost charm of the simple old
pieces of work.</p>

<p>Another room in the factory of tapestry interests those
who like to see the creation of things. It is one of the
prettiest rooms of all, and is more than ever like a kindergarten
for grown-ups. Or, if you like, it is a chamber in
a feudal castle where the women gather when the men
are gone to war.</p>

<p>Here the workers are all girls and women, each bending
over a large embroidery frame supported at a convenient
level from the floor. On one frame is a long
flowered border with cartouches in the strong rich colours
of Louis XIV. On another a sofa-seat copied from
Boucher. They are both new, but like all work fresh
from the loom are full of the open slits left in the process
of weaving, a necessity of the changing colours and the
requirements of the drawing.</p>

<p>All these little slits, varying from half an inch to several
inches in length, must be sewed with strong, careful
stitches before the tapestry can be considered complete.</p>

<p>On other frames are stretched old tapestries for repairs.
At the Gobelins as many as forty women are thus employed.
The malapropos deduction springs here that the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg&nbsp;238]</a></span>
demand for repaired old work is greater than that for
new in the famous factory, for only six or eight weavers
are there occupied.</p>

<p>Repairing is almost an art in itself. The emperor
established a small school at Berlin for training girls in
this trade. The studio of the late Mr. Ffoulke in Florence
kept twenty or thirty girls occupied. The Metropolitan
Museum of Art in New York has a repair studio
under a graduate of the Berlin school. The factories of
Baumgarten and of Herter, in New York, also conduct
repairs; and the museum at Boston as well.</p>

<p>We cannot make old tapestries, but we can restore and
preserve them by skilled labour in special ateliers.
Restoration by the needle is the only perfect restoration,
and this is as yet but little done here, although the method
is so well known in Europe. We deplore the quicker
way, to use the loom for weaving large sections of border
or large bits which have gone into hopeless shreds, or
have disappeared altogether by reason of the bitter years
when tapestries had fallen into neglect. But the quicker
way is the poorer, with these great claimants for time.
The woven figures are relentless in this, that they claim
of the living man a lion&rsquo;s share of his precious days. His
reward is that they outlast him. Food for cynics lies
there.</p>

<p>The careful worker looks close and sees the warp exposed
like fiddle strings here and there. She matches
the colour of silk and wool to the elusive shades and
covers stitch by stitch the bare threads, in perfect imitation
of the loom&rsquo;s way.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg&nbsp;239]</a></span>
Sometimes the warp is gone. Then the work tests the
best skill. The threads, the <i>cha&icirc;ne</i>, must be picked up,
one by one, and united invisibly to the new, and then the
pattern woven over with the needle. It happens that
large holes remain to be filled entirely, the pattern
matched, the design caught or imagined from some other
part of the fabric. That takes skill indeed. But it is
done, and so well, that the repairer is called not that, but
a restorer.</p>

<p>The two factories in New York, the Baumgarten and
Herter ateliers, have certain employ&eacute;s always busy with
repairs and restorations. Given even a fragment, the
rest is supplied to make a perfect whole, in these studios
where the manner of the old workers is so closely studied.
For big repairs a drawing is made, a cartoon on the same
principle as that of large cartoons, in colours, these following
the old. Then it remains for the weaver to set his
loom with the corresponding number of threads, that the
new fabric may match the old in fineness. Then, too,
comes the test of matching colours, a test that almost never
discovers a worker equal to its exactions. That is as often
as not the fault of the dyer who has supplied colours too
fresh.</p>

<p>It is the repairs done by the needle that give the best
effect, although such restorations are costly and slow.</p>

<p>Old repairs on old tapestries have been made, in some
instances, very long ago. It often happens, in old sets,
that a great piece of another tapestry has been roughly set
in, like the knee-patches of a farm boy. The object has
been merely to fill the hole, not to match colour scheme
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg&nbsp;240]</a></span>
or figure. And these patches are by the judicious restorer
taken out and their place carefully filled with the
needle.</p>

<p>Moths, say some, do not devour old tapestries. The
reason given is that the ancient wool is so desiccated as
to be no longer nutritious. A pretty argument, but not
to be trusted, for I have seen moths comfortably browsing
on a Burgundian hanging, keeping house and raising families
on such precious stuff.</p>

<p>Commerce demands that tricks shall be played in the
repair room, but not such great ones that serious corruption
will result. The coarse verdures of the Eighteenth
Century that were thrown lightly off the looms with transient
interest are sought now for coverings to antique
chairs. To give the unbroken greens more charm, an
occasional bird is snipped from a worn branch where he
has long and mutely reposed, and is posed anew on the
centre of a back or seat. It is the part of the repairer to
see that he looks at home in his new surroundings.</p>

<p>If metal threads have not been spoken of in this chapter
on <i>modus operandi</i>, it is because metal is so little used
since the time of Louis XV as to warrant omitting it.
And the little that appears seems very different from the
&ldquo;gold of Cyprus&rdquo; that made gorgeous and valuable the
tapestries of Arras, of Brussels and of old Paris.</p>

<h3>THE BAYEUX TAPESTRY</h3>

<h4>A. D. 1066</h4>


<p><span class="dropcap">S</span>O long as one word continues to have more than one
meaning, civilised man will continue to gain false
impressions. The word tapestry suffers as much as
any other&mdash;witness the attempt made for hundreds of
years among all nations to set apart a word that shall be
used only to designate the hand-woven pictured hangings
and coverings discussed in this book; arras, gobelins, <i>toile
peinte</i>, etc. In English, tapestry may mean almost any
decorative stuff, and so comes it that we speak of the wonderful
hanging which gives name to this chapter as the
tapestry of Bayeux (plates facing pages <a href="#BAYEUX_TAPESTRY01"><b>242</b></a>,
<a href="#BAYEUX_TAPESTRY02"><b>243</b></a> and
<a href="#BAYEUX_TAPESTRY03"><b>244</b></a>), when it is in reality an embroidery. But so much
is it confused with true tapestry, and so poignantly does
it interest the Anglo-Saxon that we will introduce it here,
even while acknowledging its extraneous character.</p>

<p>To begin with, then, we say frankly that it is not a
tapestry; that it has no place in this book. And then we
will trail its length through a short review of its history
and its interest as a human document of the first order.</p>

<p>In itself it is a strip of holland&mdash;brown, heavy linen
cloth, measuring in length about two hundred and thirty-one
feet, and in width, nineteen and two-thirds inches&mdash;remarkable
dimensions which are accounted for in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg&nbsp;242]</a></span>
neatest way. The hanging was used in the cathedral of
the little French city of Bayeux, draped entirely around
the nave of the Norman Cathedral, which space it exactly
covered. This indicates to archeologists the original purpose
of the hanging.</p>

<p>On the brown linen is embroidered in coloured wools
a panoramic succession of incidents, with border top and
bottom. The colours are but eight, two shades each of
green and blue, with yellow, dove-colour, red and brown.</p>

<p>This, in brief, is the great Bayeux tapestry. But its
threads breathe history; its stitches sing romance; and we
who love to touch humorously the spirits of brothers who
lived so long ago, find here the matter that humanly unites
the Eleventh Century with the Twentieth.</p>

<p>The subject is the conquest of England by William the
Conqueror in 1066. That is fixed beyond a doubt, so that
the precious cloth cannot trail its ends any further back
into antiquity than that event. However, even the most
insatiable antiquarian of European specialties is smilingly
content with such a date.</p>

<p>Legend has it that Queen Matilda, the wife of the conqueror,
executed the work as an evidence of the devotion
and adulation that were his due and her pleasure: There
are lovely pictures in the mind of Matilda in the safety
of the chambers of the old castle at Caen, directing
each day a corps of lovely ladies in the task of their historic
embroidery, each one sewing into the fabric her
own secret thoughts of lover or husband absent on the
great Conqueror&rsquo;s business. In absence of direct testimony
to the contrary, why not let us believe this which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg&nbsp;243]</a></span>
comes as near truth as any legend may, and fits the case
most pleasantly?</p>

<p>The history it portrays in all its seventy-odd yards is
easy enough to verify. That is like working out a puzzle
with the key in hand. But the history of this keenly interesting
embroidery is not so easy.</p>

<p>The records are niggardly. Inventories record it in
1369 and 1476. In an inventory of the Bishop of Bayeux
it is mentioned in 1563. About this time it was in ecclesiastical
hands and used for decorating the nave of the
Bayeux Cathedral.</p>

<p>Then the world forgot it.</p>

<p>How the world rediscovered that which was never lost
is interesting matter. Here is the story:</p>

<p>In 1724 an antiquarian found a drawing of about ten
yards long, taken from the tapestry. Here, said he and
his fellow sages, is the drawing of some wonderful, ancient
work of art, most probably a frieze or other decoration
carved in wood or stone. Naturally, the desire was
to find such a monument. But no one could remember
such a carving in any church or castle.</p>

<p>Father Montfaucon, of Saint Maur, with interest intelligent,
wrote to the prior of St. Vigor&rsquo;s at Bayeux, and
received the most satisfactory reply, that the drawing represented
not a carving but a hanging in possession of his
church, and associated with many yards more of the same
cloth.</p>

<p>So all this time the wonderful relic had lain safe in
Bayeux, and never was lost, but only forgotten by outsiders.
The rediscovery, so-called, aroused much
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg&nbsp;244]</a></span>
comment, and England declared the cloth the noblest monument
of her history.</p>

<p>It was in use at that time, and after, once a year. It
was hung around the cathedral nave on St. John&rsquo;s Day,
and left for eight days that all the people might see it.</p>

<p>The fact that it was not religious in subject, that it
could not possibly be interpreted otherwise than as a secular
history, makes remarkable its place in the cathedral.
This is explained by the suggestion that while Bishop Odo
established that precedent, all others but followed without
thought.</p>

<p>Since 1724 the world outside of Bayeux has never forgotten
this panorama of a past age, and its history is known
from that time on.</p>

<p>The Revolution of France had its effect even on this
treasure; or would have had if the clergy had not been
sufficiently capable to defend it. It was hidden in the
depositories of the cathedral until the storm was over.</p>

<p>It seems there was no treasure in Europe unknown to
Napoleon. He commanded in 1803 that the Bayeux
tapestry, of which he had heard so much, be brought to
the National Museum for his inspection. The playwrights
of Paris seized on the pictured cloth as material
for their imagination, and, refusing to take seriously the
crude figures, wrote humorously of Matilda eternally at
work over her ridiculous task, surrounded with simple
ladies equally blind to art and nature. It is only too easy
to let humour play about the ill-drawn figures. They
must be taken grandly serious, or ridicule will thrust
tongue in cheek. It is to these French plays of 1804 that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg&nbsp;245]</a></span>
we owe the firmness of the tradition that Queen Matilda
in 1066 worked the embroidery.</p>

<p class="caption">BAYEUX TAPESTRY (DETAIL), 1066</p>

<p>Napoleon returned the cloth to Bayeux, not to the
church, but to the Hotel de Ville, in which manner it
became the property of the civil authorities, instead of
the ecclesiastic. It was rolled on cylinders, that by an
easy mechanism it might be seen by visitors. But the
fabric suffered much by the handling of a curious public.
Even the most enlightened and considerate hands can
break threads which time has played with for eight centuries.</p>

<p>It was decided, therefore, to give the ancient <i>toile
fatigu&eacute;e</i> a quiet, permanent home. For this purpose a
museum was built, and about 1835 the great Bayeux
tapestry was carefully installed behind glass, its full length
extended on the walls for all to see who journey thither
and who ring the guardian&rsquo;s bell at the courtyard&rsquo;s handsome
portico.</p>

<p>Once since then, once only, has the venerable fabric
left its cabinet. This was at the time of the Prussians
when, in 1871, France trembled for even her most intimate
and special treasures.</p>

<p>The tapestry was taken from its case, rolled with care
and placed in a zinc cylinder, hermetically sealed. Then
it was placed far from harm; but exactly where, is a
secret that the guardians of the tapestry do well to conserve.
There might be another trouble, and asylum
needed for the treasure in the future.</p>

<p>The pictures of the great embroidery are such as a child
might draw, for crudeness; but the archeologist knows
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg&nbsp;246]</a></span>
how to read into them a thousand vital points. History
helps out, too, with the story of Harold, moustached like
the proper Englishman of to-day, taking a commission
from William, riding gaily out on a gentleman&rsquo;s errand,
not a warrior&rsquo;s. This is shown by the falcon on his wrist,
that wonderful bird of the Middle Ages that marked the
gentleman by his associations, marked the high-born man
on an errand of peace or pleasure.</p>

<p>In these travelling days, no sooner do we land in Normandy
than Mount St. Michael looms up as a happy
pilgrimage. So to the same religious refuge Harold
went on the pictured cloth, crossed the adjacent river in
peril, and&mdash;how pleasingly does the past leap up and tap
the present&mdash;he floundered in the quicksands that surround
the Mount, and about which the driver of your
carriage across the <i>passerelle</i> will tell you recent tales
of similar flounderings.</p>

<p>And when in Brittany, who does not go to tumbley-down
Dinan to see its ancient gates and walls, its palaces
of Queen Anne, its lurching crowd of houses? It is
thither that Harold, made of threads of ancient wool,
sped and gave battle after the manner of his time.</p>

<p>Another link to make us love this relic of the olden
time: It is the star, the star so great that the space of
the picture is all too small to place it; so the excited hands
of the embroiderers set it outside the limit, in the border.</p>

<p>It flames over false Harold&rsquo;s head and he remembers
sombrely that it is an omen of a change of rule. He is
king now, has usurped a throne, has had himself crowned.
But for how long is he monarch, with this flaming menace
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg&nbsp;247]</a></span>
burning into his courage? The year finishing saw the
prophecy fulfilled by the coming of the conqueror.</p>

<p>It was this section of the tapestry that, when it came
to Paris, had power to startle Napoleon, ever superstitious,
ever ready to read signs. The star over Harold&rsquo;s
head reminded him of the possible brevity of his own
eminence.</p>

<p>The star that blazed in 1066&mdash;we have found it. It
was not imaginary. Behold how prettily the bits of history
fit together, even though we go far afield to find those
bits. This one comes from China. Records were better
kept there in those times than in Christian Europe; and
the Chinese astronomers write of a star appearing April
2, 1066, which was seen first in the early morning sky,
then after a time disappeared to reappear in the evening
sky, with a flaming tail, most agreeably sensational. It
was Halley&rsquo;s comet, the same that we watched in 1910
with no superstitious fear at all for princes nor for powers.
But it is interesting to know that our modern comet
was recorded in China in the Eleventh Century, and has
its portrait on the Bayeux tapestry, and that it frightened
the great Harold into a fit of guilty conscience.</p>

<p>The archeologist gives reason for the faith that is in
him concerning the Bayeux tapestry by reading the language
of its details, such as the style of arms used by its
preposterous soldiers; by gestures; by groupings of its
figures; and we are only too glad to believe his wondrous
deductions.</p>

<p>There are in all fifteen hundred and twelve figures in
this celebrated cloth, if one includes birds, beasts, boats,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg&nbsp;248]</a></span>
<i>et cetera</i>, with the men; and amidst all this elongated
crowd is but one woman. Queen Matilda, left at home
for months, immured with her ladies, probably had quite
enough of women to refrain easily from portraying them.
Needless to say, this one embroidered lady interests poignantly
the archeologist.</p>

<p>Most of the animals are in the border&mdash;active little
beasts who make a running accompaniment to the tale
they adorn. This excepts the very wonderful horses ridden
by knights of action.</p>

<p>Scenes of the pictured history of William&rsquo;s conquest
are divided one from the other by trees. Possibly the
archeologist sees in these evidences of extinct varieties,
for not in all this round, green world do trees grow like
unto those of the Bayeux tapestry. They are dream
trees from the gardens of the Hesperides, and set in useful
decoration to divide event from event and to give sensations
to the student of the tree in ornament.</p>

<p>Such is the Bayeux tapestry, which, as was conscientiously
forewarned, is not a tapestry at all, but the most
interesting embroidery of Europe.</p>

<h2 class="padtop">CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<h3>TO-DAY</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE making of inspired tapestry does not belong to
to-day. The <i>amour propre</i> suffers a distinct pain
in this acknowledgment. It were far more agreeable
to foster the feeling that this age is in advance of
any other, that we are at the front of the world&rsquo;s progress.</p>

<p>So we are in many matters, but those matters are all
bent toward one thing&mdash;making haste. Economy of time
occupies the attention of scientist, inventor, labourer.
Yet a lavish expenditure of time is the one thing the perfect
tapestry inexorably demands, and that is the fundamental
reason why it cannot now enter a brilliant period
of production like those of the past.</p>

<p>It is not that one atelier cannot find enough weavers to
devote their lives to sober, leisurely production; it is that
the stimulating effect is gone, of a craft eagerly pursued
in various centres, where guilds may be formed, where
healthy rivalry spurs to excellence, where the world of
the fine arts is also vitally concerned.</p>

<p>The great hangings of the past were the natural expression
of decoration in those days, the natural demand of
pomp, of splendour and of comfort. As in all things
great and small, the act is but the visible expression of
an inward impulse, and we of to-day have not the spirit
that expresses itself in the reverent building of cathedrals,
or in the inspired composition of tapestries.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg&nbsp;250]</a></span>
This is to be entirely distinguished from appreciation.
That gift we have, and it is momentarily increasing. To
be entirely commercial, which view is of course not the
right one, one need only watch the reports of sales at
home and abroad to see what this latter-day appreciation
means in pelf. In England a tapestry was recently unearthed
and identified as one of the series of seven woven
for Cardinal Woolsey. It is not of extraordinary size,
but was woven in the interesting years hovering above
and below the century mark of 1500. The time was when
public favour spoke for the upholding of morality with
a conspicuousness which could be called Puritanism, were
the anachronism possible. Pointing a moral was the
fundamental excuse for pictorial art. This tapestry represents
one of <i>The Seven Deadly Sins</i>. Hampton Court
displays the three other known pieces of the series, and
he who harbours this most recent discovery has paid
$33,000 for the privilege.</p>

<p>But that is a tiny sum compared to the price that rumour
accredits Mr. Morgan with paying for <i>The Adoration
of the Eternal Father</i> (called also <i>The Kingdom of
Heaven</i>). And this is topped by $750,000 paid for a
Boucher set of five pieces. One might continue to enumerate
the sales where enormous sums are laid down in
appreciation of the men whose excellence of work we
cannot achieve, but these sums paid only show with pathetic
discouragement the completeness with which the
spirit of commercialism has replaced the spirit of art, at
least in the expression of art that occupies our attention.</p>

<p>If, then, this is not an age of production, but of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg&nbsp;251]</a></span>
appreciation, it, too, has its natural expression. First it is the
acquiring at any sacrifice of the ancient hangings wherever
they are found; and after that it is their restoration
and preservation. This is the reason for recent high
prices and the reason, too, for the establishment of ateliers
of repair, which are found in all large centres in Europe
as well as wherever any important museum exists in
America.</p>

<p>It would not be possible nor profitable to dwell on the
tapestry repair shops of Europe. They have always been;
the industry is one that has existed since the Burgundian
dukes tore holes in their magnificent tapestries by dragging
them over the face of Europe, and since Henry the
Eighth, in eager imitation of the continentals, established
in the royal household a supervisor of tapestry repairs.
Paris is full of repairers, and in the little streets on the
other side of the Seine old women sit in doorways on a
sunny day, defeating the efforts of time to destroy the
loved <i>toiles peintes</i>. But this haphazard repair, done on
the knee, as a garment might be mended, is not comparable
to the careful, exact work of the restorer at her frame.
One ranks as woman&rsquo;s natural task of nine stitches, while
the other is the work of intelligent patience and skilled
endeavour.</p>

<p>Wherever looms are set up, a department of repair is
the logical accompaniment. As every tapestry taken
from the loom appears punctured with tiny slits, places
left open in the weaving, and as all of these need careful
sewing before the tapestry is finished, a corps of needlewomen
is a part of a loom&rsquo;s equipment. This is true in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg&nbsp;252]</a></span>
all but the ateliers of the Merton Abbey factory, of which
we shall speak later.</p>

<p>Apart from repairs, what is being done in the present
day? So little that historians of the future are going to
find scant pickings for their record.</p>


<h4>FRANCE</h4>

<p>The Gobelins factory being the last one to make a permanent
contribution to art, the impulse is to ask what
it is doing now. That is easily answered, but there is
no man so optimistic that he can find therein matter for
hope.</p>

<p>France is commendably determined not to let the great
industry die. It would seem a loss of ancient glory to
shut down the Gobelins. Yet why does it live? It lives
because a body of men have the patriotic pride to keep
it alive. But as for its products, they are without inspiration,
without beauty to the eye trained to higher expressions
of art.</p>

<p>The Gobelins to-day is almost purely a museum, not
only in the treasures it exposes in its collection of ancient
&ldquo;toiles,&rdquo; but because here is preserved the use of the high-warp
loom, and the same method of manufacture as in
other and better times. A crowd of interested folk drift
in and out between the portals, survey the Pavilion of
Louis XIV and the court, the garden and the stream, then,
turning inside, the modern surveys the work of the ancient,
the remnants of time. And no less curious and no
less remote do the old tapestries seem than the atelier
where the high looms rear their cylinders and mute men
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg&nbsp;253]</a></span>
play their colour harmonies on the warp. It all seems
of other times; it all seems dead. And it is a dead art.</p>

<p class="caption">GOBELINS TAPESTRY. LATE NINETEENTH CENTURY</p>

<p class="incaption">Pantheon, Paris</p>

<p>The tapestries on the looms are garish, crude, modern
art in its cheapest expression; or else they are brilliant-hued
copies of time-softened paintings that were never
meant to be translated into wool and silk.</p>

<p>The looms are always busy, nevertheless. There is
always preserved a staff of officers, the director, the chemist
of dyes, and all that; and the tapissiers are careful
workmen, with perfection, not haste, in view. The State
directs the work, the State pays for it, the State consumes
the products. That is the Republic&rsquo;s way of continuing
the craft that was the serious pleasure of kings. But
there is now no personal element to give it the vital touch.
There is no Gabrielle d&rsquo;Estr&eacute;es, nor Henri IV; no
Medici, no Louis XIV, no Pompadour. All is impersonal,
uninspired.</p>

<p>Men who have worked in the deadening influence of
the Gobelins declare that the factory cannot last much
longer. But it is improbable that France&mdash;Republican
France, that holds with bourgeois tenacity to aristocratic
evidences&mdash;will abandon this, her expensive toy, her inheritance
of the time of kings.</p>

<p>In the time of the Second Empire it was the fashion
to copy, at the Gobelins, the portraits of celebrated
personages executed by Winterhalter. The exquisite
portrait of the beautiful Empress Eug&eacute;nie by this delectable
court painter has a delicacy and grace that is all
unhurt by contrast with more modern schools of painting.
But fancy the texture of the lovely flesh copied in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg&nbsp;254]</a></span>
medium of woven threads, no matter how delicately dyed
and skilfully wrought. Painting is one art, tapestry-making
is entirely another.</p>

<p>But that is just where the fault lay and continued, the
inability of the Gobelins ateliers to understand that the
two must not be confused. The same false idea that
caused Winterhalter&rsquo;s portraits to be copied, gave to the
modern tapissiers the paintings of the high Renaissance
to reproduce. Titian&rsquo;s most celebrated works were set
up on the loom, as for example the beautiful fancy known
as <i>Sacred and Profane Love</i>, which perplexes the loiterer
of to-day in the Villa Borghese. Other paintings copied
were Raphael&rsquo;s <i>Transfiguration</i>, Guido Ren&eacute;&rsquo;s <i>Aurora</i>,
Andrea del Sarto&rsquo;s <i>Charity</i>. There were many more, but
this list gives sufficiently well the condition of inspiration
at the Gobelins up to the third quarter of the Nineteenth
Century.</p>

<p>Paul Baudry appeared at about this time striking a
clear pure note of delicate decoration. The few panels
that he drew for the Gobelins charm the eye with happy
reminiscences of Lebrun, of Claude Audran, a potpourri
of petals fallen from the roses of yesterday mixed with
the spices of to-day.</p>

<p>But if the work of this talented artist illustrates anything,
it is the change in the uses of tapestries. The modern
ones are made to be framed, as flat as the wall against
which they are secured. In a word, they take the place
of frescoes. The pleasure of touching a mobile fabric is
lost. A fold in such a dainty piece would break its
beauty. Almost must a woven panel of our day fit the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg&nbsp;255]</a></span>
panel it fills as exactly as the wood-work of a room fits
its dimensions.</p>

<p>The Nineteenth Century at the Gobelins was finished
by mistakenly copying Ghirlandajo, Correggio, others of
their time.</p>

<p>In the beginning of this century, the spirit of pure decoration
again became animated. Instead of copying old
painters, the Gobelins began to copy old cartoons. The
effect of this is to increase the responsibility of the weaver,
and with responsibility comes strength.</p>

<p>The models of Boucher, and the <i>Grotesques</i> of Italian
Renaissance drawing are given even now to the weavers
as a training in both taste and skill. But better than all
is the present wisdom of the Gobelins, which has directly
faced the fact that it were better to copy the tapestries of
old excellence than to copy paintings of no matter what
altitude of art.</p>

<p>Modern cartoons are used, as we know, commanded
for various public buildings in France, but the copying
of old tapestries exercises a far happier influence on the
weavers. If this is not an age of creation in art, at least
it need not be an age of false gods, notwithstanding the
seriousness given to distortions of the Matisse and post-impressionist
school.</p>

<p>A careful copying of old tapestries&mdash;and in this case
old means those of the high periods of perfection&mdash;has
led to a result from which much may be expected. This
is the enormous reduction in the number of tones used.
Gothic tapestries of stained glass effect had a restricted
range of colour. By this brief gamut the weaver made
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg&nbsp;256]</a></span>
his own gradations of colour, and the passage from light
to shadow, by hatching, which was in effect but a weaving
of alternating lines of two colours, much as an artist
in pen-and-ink draws parallel lines for shading. Tapestries
thus woven resist well the attacks of light and time.</p>

<p>To sum up the present attitude of the Gobelins, then,
is to say that the director of to-day encourages the education
of taste in the weavers by encouraging them to copy
old tapestries instead of paintings old or new, and in a
reduction of the number of the tones employed. The
talent of an artist is thus made necessary to the tapissier,
for shadings are left to him to accomplish by his own skill
instead of by recourse to the forty thousand shades that
are stored on the shelves of the store-room.</p>

<p>The manufactory at Beauvais, being also under the
State, is associated with the greater factory in the glance
at modern conditions. Both factories weave primarily
for the State. Both factories keep alive an ancient industry,
and both have permission to sell their precious
wares to the private client. That such sales are rarely
made is due to the indifference of the State, which stipulates
that its own work shall have first place on the looms,
that only when a loom is idle may it be used for a private
patron. The length of time, therefore, that must elapse
before an order is executed&mdash;two or three years, perhaps&mdash;is
a tiresome condition that very few will accept.</p>

<p>Beauvais, with its low-warp looms, is more celebrated
for its small pieces of work than for large hangings. The
tendency toward the latter ended some time ago, and in
our time Beauvais makes mainly those exquisite coverings
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg&nbsp;257]</a></span>
for seats and screens that give the beholder a thrill
of artistic joy and a determination to possess something
similar. The models of B&eacute;hagle, Oudry, Charron are
copied with fidelity to their loveliness, and it is these that
after a few years of wear on furniture take on that mellowness
which long association with human hands alone
can give. It is scarcely necessary to say that antique furniture
tapestry is rare; its use has been too hard to withstand
the years. Therefore, we may with joy and the
complacency of good taste acquire new coverings of the
Don Quixote or &AElig;sop&rsquo;s Fables designs for our latter-day
furniture or for the fine old pieces from which the original
tapestries have vanished.</p>


<h4>ENGLAND</h4>

<p>The chapter on Mortlake looms shows what was accomplished
by deliberate importation of an art coveted but
not indigenous. It is interesting to compare this with
England&rsquo;s entirely modern and self-made craft of the last
thirty years. I allude to the tapestry factory established
by William Morris and called Merton Abbey. Mr.
Morris preferred the word arras as attached to his weavings,
tapestry having sometimes the odious modern meaning
of machine-made figured stuffs for any sort of furniture
covering. But as Arras did not invent the high-warp
hand-loom, nor did the Saracens, nor the Egyptians, it
is but quibbling to give it arbitrarily the name of any
particular locale.</p>

<p>It seems that enough can never be said about the versatility
of William Morris and the strong flood of beauty
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg&nbsp;258]</a></span>
in design that he sent rippling over arid ground. It were
enough had he accomplished only the work in tapestry.
It is not too strong a statement that he produced at Merton
Abbey the only modern tapestries that fill the primary
requirements of tapestries.</p>

<p>How did he happen upon it in these latter days? By
worshipping the old hangings of the Gothic perfection,
by finding the very soul of them, of their designers and
of their craftsmen; then, letting that soul enter his, he
set his fingers reverently to work to learn, as well, the
secret of the ancient workman.</p>

<p>It was as early as 1885 that he began; was cartoonist,
dyer, tapissier, all, for the experiment, which was a small
square of verdure after the manner of the Gothic, curling
big acanthus leaves about a softened rose, a mingling of
greens of ocean and shady reds. Perhaps it was no great
matter in the way of tapestry, but it was to Morris like
the discovery of a new continent to the navigator.</p>

<p>His was the time of a so-called &aelig;sthetic school in England.
Watts, Rossetti and Burne-Jones were harking
back to antiquity for inspiration. Morris associated with
him the latter, who drew wondrous figures of maids and
men and angels, figures filled with the devout spirit of the
time when religion was paramount, and perfect with the
art of to-day.</p>

<p>The romance of <i>The Holy Grail</i> gave happy theme for
the work, and three beautiful tapestries made the set.
<i>The Adoration of the Magi</i> was another, made for Exeter
College, Oxford. Sir Edward Burne-Jones designed
all these wondrous pictures, and the wisdom of Morris
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg&nbsp;259]</a></span>
decreed that the <i>Grail</i> series should not be oft repeated.
The first figure tapestry woven on the looms was a fancy
drawn by Walter Crane, called <i>The Goose Girl</i>.</p>

<p class="incaption">Merton Abbey Tapestry. Byram Shaw, Artist</p>

<p>The most enchantingly medi&aelig;val and most modernly
perfect piece is by Burne-Jones, called <i>David Instructing
Solomon in the Building of the Temple</i>. (Plate facing
page <a href="#DAVID_INSTRUCTING_SOLOMON"><b>257</b></a>.) In this the time of Gothic beauty lives again.
Planes are repeated, figures are massed, detail is clear and
impressive, yet modern laws of drawing concentrate the
interest on the central action as strongly as though all else
were subservient.</p>

<p><i>The Passing of Venus</i> was Burne-Jones&rsquo; last cartoon
for Merton Abbey looms. (Plate facing page <a href="#PASSING_OF_VENUS"><b>260</b></a>.)
Although a critique of the art of this great painter would
be out of place in a book on the applied arts, at least it is
allowable to express the conviction that more beautiful,
more fitting designs for tapestry it would be difficult to
imagine. Modern work of this sort has produced nothing
that approaches them, preserving as they do the sincerity
and reverence of a simple people, the ideality of a conscientious
age, yet softening all technical faults with modern
finish. An unhappy fact is that this tapestry, which
was considered by the Merton Abbey works as its <i>chef
d&rsquo;&oelig;uvre</i>, was destroyed by fire in the Brussels Exhibition
of 1910.</p>

<p>Alas for tapestry weaving of to-day, the usual modern
cartoon is a staring anachronism, and a conglomerate of
modes. An &ldquo;art nouveau&rdquo; lady poses in a Gothic setting,
a Thayer angel stands in a Boucher entourage, and both
eye and intelligence are revolted. The master craftsman
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg&nbsp;260]</a></span>
and artist, William Morris, alone has known how to produce
acceptable modern work from modern cartoons.
Other examples are <i>Angeli Laudantes</i>, and <i>The Adoration</i>.
(Plates facing pages <a href="#ANGELI_LAUDANTES"><b>261</b></a> and <a href="#THE_ADORATION"><b>256</b></a>.)</p>

<p>A false note is sometimes struck, even in this factory
of wondrous taste. In <i>Truth Blindfolded</i> (plate facing
page <a href="#TRUTH_BLINDFOLDED"><b>258</b></a>), Mr. Byram Shaw has drawn the central
figure as Cabanel might have done a decade ago, while
every other figure in the group might have been done by
some hand dead these four hundred years.</p>

<p>Morris&rsquo; manner of procedure differed little from that
of the decorator Lebrun, although his work was a private
enterprise and in no way to be compared with the
royal factory of a rich king. Burne-Jones drew the
figures; H. Dearle, a pupil, and Philip Webb drew backgrounds
and animals, but Morris held in his own hands
the arrangement of all. It was as though a gardener
brought in a sheaf of cut roses and the master hand
arranged them. Mr. Dearle directed some compositions
with skill and talent.</p>

<p>With the passing of William Morris an inevitable
change is visible in the cartoons. The Gothic note is not
continued, nor the atmosphere of sanctity, which is its
usual accompaniment. A tapestry of 1908 from the design
of <i>The Chace</i> by Heyward Sumner suggests long
hours with the Flemish landscapists of the Seventeenth
and Eighteenth Centuries, with a jarring note of Pan
dragged in by the ears to huddle under foliage obviously
introduced for this purpose.</p>

<p>But criticism of this aberration cannot hurt the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg&nbsp;261]</a></span>
wondrous inspired work directed by Morris, and which it
were well for a beauty-loving world to have often repeated.
Unhappily, the Merton Abbey works are bound
not to repeat the superb series of the <i>Grail</i>. The entire
set has been woven twice, and three pieces of it a third
time&mdash;and there it ends. This is well for the value of the
tapestries, but is it not a providence too thrifty when the
public is considered? In ages to come, perhaps, other
looms will repeat, and our times will glow with the fame
thereof.</p>

<p>Before leaving the subject of the Merton Abbey tapestries,
it is interesting to note a technical change in the
weaving. By intertwisting the threads of the chain or
warp at the back, a way is found to avoid the slits in weaving
that are left to be sewn together with the needle in all
old work. This method has been proved the stronger of
the two. The strain of hanging proves too great for the
strength of the stitches, and on many a tapestry appear
gaping wounds which call for yet more stitching. But
in the new method the fabric leaves the loom intact.</p>

<p>The determination of William Morris to catch old
secrets by fitting his feet into old footsteps, led him to
employ only the loom of the best weavers in the ancient
long ago. The high-warp loom is the only one in use
at the Merton Abbey works.</p>


<h4>AMERICA</h4>

<p>America makes heavy demands for tapestries, but the
art of producing them is not indigenous here. We are
not without looms, however. The first piece of tapestry
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg&nbsp;262]</a></span>
woven in America&mdash;to please the ethnologist we will
grant that it was woven by Zu&ntilde;i or Toltec or other
aborigine. But the fabric approaching that of Arras or
Gobelins, was woven in New York, in 1893, in the looms
of the late William Baumgarten. It is preserved as a
curiosity, as being the first. It is a chair seat woven after
the designs popular with Louis XV and his court, a plain
background of solid colour on which is thrown a floral
ornament.</p>

<p>The loom was a small affair of the low-warp type, and
was operated by a Frenchman who came to this country
for the purpose of starting the craft on new soil.</p>

<p>The sequence to this small beginning was the establishment
of tapestry ateliers at Williamsbridge, a suburb of
New York. Like the Gobelins factory, this was located
in an old building on the banks of a little stream, the
Bronx. Workmen were imported, some from Aubusson,
who knew the craft; these took apprentices, as of
old, and trained them for the work. The looms were all
of the low-warp pattern.</p>

<p>It may be of interest to those who like figures, to know
that the work of the Baumgarten atelier averages in price
about sixty dollars a square yard. Perhaps this will help
a little in deciding whether or not the price is reasonable
when a dealer seductively spreads his ancient wares.
Modern cartoons of the Baumgarten factory lack the
charm of the old designs, but the adaptations and copies
of ancient pieces are particularly happy. No better execution
could be wished for. The factory has increased its
looms to the number of twenty-two, and has its regular
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg&nbsp;263]</a></span>
corps of tapissiers, dyers, repairers, etc. Nowhere is the
life of the weaver so nearly like that of his prototype in
the golden age of tapestry. The colony on the Bronx is
like a bit of old Europe set intact on American soil.</p>

<p class="incaption">From Herter Looms, New York, 1910</p>

<p>It is odd that New York should have more tapestry
looms at work than has Paris. The Baumgarten looms
exceed in number the present Gobelins, and the Herter
looms add many more. The ateliers of Albert Herter
are in the busiest part of New York, and here are woven
by hand many fabrics of varying degrees of excellence.
It is not Mr. Herter&rsquo;s intention to produce only fine wall
hangings, but to supply as well floor coverings &ldquo;a la fa&ccedil;on
de Perse,&rdquo; as the ancient documents had it, and to make it
possible for persons of taste, but not necessarily fortune,
to have hand-woven porti&egrave;res of artistic value.</p>

<p>Apart from this commendable aim, the Herter looms
are also given to making copies of the antique in the finest
of weaving, and to producing certain original pieces expressing
the decorative spirit of our day. Besides this,
the work is distinguished by certain combinations of
antique and modern style that confuse the seeker after
purity of style. That the effect is pleasing must be
acknowledged as illustrated in the plate showing a tapestry
for the country house of Mrs. E. H. Harriman.
(Plate facing page <a href="#DRYADS_AND_FAUNS"><b>263</b></a>.) It is not easy in a review of
tapestry weaving of to-day to find any great encouragement.</p>

<p>These are times of commerce more than of art. If art
can be made profitable commercially, well and good. If
not, it starves in a garret along with the artist. If the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg&nbsp;264]</a></span>
demand for modern tapestries was large enough, the art
would flourish&mdash;perhaps. But it is not a large demand,
for many reasons, chief among which is the incontrovertible
one that the modern work is seldom pleasing. The
whole world is occupied with science and commerce, and
art does not create under their influence as in more ideal
times. What can the trained eye and the cultivated taste
do other than turn back to the products of other days?</p>

<p>We have artists in our own country whose qualities
would make of them marvellous composers of cartoons.
The imagination and execution of Maxfield Parrish, for
example, added to his richness of colouring, would be
translatable in wool under the hands of an artist-weaver.
And the designs which take the name of &ldquo;poster&rdquo; and are
characterised by strength, simplicity and few tones, why
would they not give the same crispness of detail that constitutes
one of the charms of Gothic work? Perhaps the
factories existent in America will work out this line of
thought, combine it with honesty of material and labour,
and give us the honour of prominence in an ancient art&rsquo;s
revival.</p>
